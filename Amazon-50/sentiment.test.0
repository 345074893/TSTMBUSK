i used to love this place , the new manager is an idiot , my food came out raw , yes raw . when i brought it to his attention he had the nerve to say : it 's only $ 8.00 dude get over it .
i have nothing good to say about this place . went to visit my gf at work a few weeks ago and we were craving sushi after walking around and saw this restaurant .
if you like sausages , edm and the smell of bleach , this place is for you ! trying way too hard to be swank in a town much better suited to chill lounge . the only good thing is that i discovered ami 's next door .
i was a customer for two years . i had no problems at first , until they continued with harassing phone calls that i was late on my payments , even i pay them online and on time . what kind of company are they ?
i asked if they could do a certain deal on the vehicle and the manager responded , well if you get the us government to not charge sales tax i would . '' i will never frequent this dealership as they have the mindset of a child .
reasonably priced but the food was not good . ordered shrimp fried rice , the shrimp was rubbery and had a very intense fishy smell . the mongolian beef had a weird taste to it and made my friend sick . the orange chicken was bland .
quoted me one price then come to appointment and it was twice the quote . wasted 2 hours of my time .
just unbelievably dissapointed with them on many levels . all about the copay and charging insurance and then as well overcharging for things they know arent covered and still let you wait 2 months for an appointment to have done .
my daughter wanted a pair of flip flops for her birthday . went into store to purchase . staff was ok until time to pay . sales person took both my card and daughters . she ran cards and we both got notification on our phones of transaction .
i went here for an oil change around 8am on a saturday morning . when i got there i was told one hour , so i said i 'd be back in 1 hour .
so i ordered take out . teriyaki chicken plate $ 16.99 . i must say that no forks or napkins , no complementary bread and the quality and the portion was very poor . i dont get it .
bad service and food . when we first walked in we noticed the place was very run down and dirty . the seat had rips all over it , the floor was dirty , the grill in the middle of the table had food crusted on the sides .
for your own protection do not use dakota landscaping and handyman service for any project . 1. will only return calls for estimates on new jobs . only recieved 2 returned calls . 2. works only 3 to 4 hours a day 3. did not complete work as directed .
ok so i guess i will google this place as the website here is a bogus one that takes you to some singles site . i was interested in finding a studio that offered adult dance lessons classes , this came up and no legit info .
if i could give 0 stars i would ! the food itself really is n't the issue . i have been to east coast wings in other cities and the food is decent . i moved here a year ago and we had our first experience here .
the worst meal my family and i have ever , ever eaten ! the burrata was chewy and difficult to cut or spread . the pasta has a strange consistency and mine was freezing cold .
wow , what a jerk ! i do n't write terrible reviews but this one is a piece of work . i ordered takeout from them and they skipped the soup because i am not a regular .
sonic boom has a lot of potential , nice looking spacious music wonder world , if it would only offer you more for your decent used cd 's .
really disappointed with the quality and quantity of this food . not very good flavors and the butter chicken had the same sauce as the tikka masala . major issue with their flavors and makes me wonder where they got their recipes .
zero rating . we have a home warranty with american home shield company who sent out this company to repair our dryer . they came out four times to try to fix . said it was the motor and said they replaced it .
lousy food and service this trip . used to be a fantastic breakfast spot but since changed ownership it has really gone down hill . recommend you skip this one .
i am new to the area and was asked to go to the first panther games so i decided why not . let me start by saying this is a really weird place kinda man creepy .
the southwest wildlife conservation center is a zoo ( not a conservation center ) located in scottsdale arizona .
i 've been here three different times and every time regardless of how many customers are in store the wait is ridiculous . they have about 7-9 stations yet only use two or three to help people . waiting 1-2 hours is not ideal for customer service .
no one acknowledged us . it was dead . red wine came in a freezing glass ? could not find our waitress to pay the bill when she did come , she seemed annoyed . ugh . would never go back !
i 've been here about 3.5 hours . so far ice machine on 4th floor is broke . all water in machines sold out . machine took my money 3 times trying to buy a gatorade . they did pay me that back .
so 3 mos later the used car i was told had 30 day warranty then later told it did n't then tried to purchase extended warranty but was told bank would n't finance the extra but it anything goes wrong just bring it in .
i 'm so disappointed in this water company . i have been going there for years . i bought all my bottles and alkaline water from them .
i would give these guys 0 stars if i could , lies , lies , lies ! called and book my appt a day in advance . then the next day , waiting . waiting for them to come i call to see where they were ?
i have yet to move into the apartment complex , but the experience is already a huge let down . i was quoted a move in price one day , the next day they increased the cost over $ 200 .
i do n't recommend them at all . i repeat do not go with them . they took a long time packing and then did n't do a thorough job . their job seemed hurried . they did n't hang up all my clothes on hangers .
well . the only joy here was when i was riding home putting this place in my rear view mirror . truly a letdown . the place was busy ( it does have a great atmosphere ) . my wife and i were excited to try the food out .
i came here for a pedicure and gel fill . unfortunately what i got was a horrible pedicure and an acrylic fill . jimmy was horrible ! i had to wait over 30 minutes for him to start my pedicure .
we are huge taco bell fans and have grown up eating taco bell our entire lives . while driving on our road trip , we stopped at this location for an early dinner , and we truely dissapointed and sad .
i really need to stop coming back . every single time , and i mean every single time i go to kfc they manage to get my order completely wrong . it 's so frustrating the lack of customer service and quality insurance .
i am absolutely disappointed in something i expect to be great ! i live so close by and remembered the appearance of their great pastry case . ya , tonight was horrible for a dessert lover ! my cheesecake factory holiday vanilla '' cupcake was an embarrassment !
another place with good products but crappy sales people . do n't ask anyone for help there because they wo n't help you . i waited and waited for someone to see me but they went and helped someone else .
my niece and i are traveling sushi connoisseur 's so for those that think this score is low , remember this is only based on our sushi experience . the rolls were nice looking but there was something about them that is kinda hard to point out .
this is the only place i 've ever eaten at where i was almost overcome by a desire to stand up and say , attention everyone ! you do n't have to eat this crap ! there are other restaurants ! you can go elsewhere !
i used them and never again . too big of hurry to get to the next job . read there complete contract before you use them . they put the ceiling fans back up and there all out of balance .
if i could give this place zero stars , i would . we were part of a party of nine . each couple ordered one or two appetizers .
visited this pub today , and was very disappointed with state of the place . seats are stained most tables were dirty . first beer was flat and food took way too long . overall just a run down pub . prices are too high .
it does n't matter if you have an appointment you still wait over an hour without anyone acknowledging that ur presence . had the worst nail job i have ever had with technician kim . my gel nails only lasted two weeks . do not come back here .
i gave up on this store last year - the prices were never great and the service was repeatedly awful ( especially when leaving your guitar for maintenance - do n't do it ) . my advice is not to bother with it .
if you 're looking for freaky fast delivery with average custom service look elsewhere . this location has the worst custom service . i encourage anyone thinking about placing a delivery order to find someplace to order food from or drive there yourself . you will get it faster .
low quality meat , i do not recommend this place . i got sick after eating their meat
new owners . terrible customer service . when we first started coming to desert car care in gilbert a few years back we loved the place .
9 times out , could n't fix it ! clueless , including the office . no call backs , had to call them . the manager could care less and rude . had another company out , fixed it the first time .
bad i stayed near the check out desk . people going in and out yelling from staff drunk employees
i keep hanging up on me and that 's very rude and customer service discount tire sucks
got here at 9:45 am and it 's now 11:45 am with no employees present to work ! i guess business must but good to have this location closed or have their employees make their own schedule .
worst panera location and i 've been to quite a few . they 're always out of bread ( mainly ciabatta ) . we went twice because i wanted something fresh and i love their broccoli cheese soup , but they never have bread for my sandwich .
contracted r & r via lowes install services to come out and redo a dishwasher install that was incorrectly done the first time by r & r .
how can anyone visit the boutique when there is no address listed ? plus , when i tried to click on another post that said it was closed , the response from the owner ca n't be seen . not going to get business that way
do not trust these people ! they promised me delivery last thursday so i took the day off work . no call and no show . when i called they said they were waiting on a few of my items and would have it to me on saturday .
service needs a lot of improvement . ordered to go at 7pm , got food at 7:40 . thank goodness we decided to stay and eat because they got our order wrong . no apology given . wo n't be coming back for sure .
i want to like this place because it is near the house but the incredibly poor service makes that impossible . with so many people out of work you would think they would be able to hire someone mildly competent .
i am sorry to have to do this because the therapists at this location are fantastic . however , beware of getting their membership because you can not get an appointment .
this company just bought our building . they are impossible to get a hold of .
avoid this place at all cost ! the only reason i came here was because they open early . my family and i was here for breakfast . we ordered a few noodle soups and congee .
i was really hoping this place would be great but after eating here several times i am very unimpressed . the food is okay but the service is terrible .
this is quite possibly the worst restaurant i have ever ordered from . i should have just lit my thirty dollars on fire , because my dinner was completely inedible ! absolutely disgusting .
yeah . never flying them again. their fares might seem cheap but after their carry on fees and anything else it 's not to much . they rob many of their first time customers as they will charge them $ 100 at the gate for a carry on .
i used to come here frequently for the margaritas and the authentic food , until cinco de mayo 2016 . the food has honestly always been very mediocre , but that night was a whole new low in terms of preparation , management and service .
horrible service . they will charge you $ 35 tax on a sale of $ 45 . plus always speaking chinese in front of the clients . go to another chinese store. this sucks .
shady pricing ! i took my 12 year old nephew there and they charged me $ 17.00 for a fade . the price chart say that children under 13 are $ 14.00 .
in search of cake pops . not here . this place was so dirty . i would never buy anything from here . i went for cake pop 's or cupcakes .
first time here and it was ghetto ! people in line were so ghetto . this little boy , about 8 , was getting ice , spilled the ice cause he got too much and then got more ice . what a waste and where was the parent ?
really bummed to leave this because she seemed really sweet . i communicated with her through email for 2 days , then she just never got back to me . called her even and left vm & still nothing .
food is eh . had the ribs , they were grisly . service was the biggest joke . you stand in a confusing line where no one listens to you then you get to the register .
thieves the rental started off good , got our car and had it for 3 days with no problems . the problem started when we returned the car . we accidentally left a wallet in the glove box and did n't realize it until we were at the airport .
the employees here are absolutely crazy and overly pushy . no matter how good the tea is ( and it 's amazing ) , i will never go here again .
this days inn is a complete dump . horrible service , they double booked my room and shorted my stay and had to relocate . plus the room was awful , toilet was running , a c turned off an on the whole night .
it started with a long check in , and ended with a sad breakfast of cereal and well past ripe bananas .
not sure this is worthy of any stars . 2 lousy slices of meat as opposed to 3-4 . i figured i 'd load up on veggies since i was getting ripped off . he grabs a hand full of black olives and gives me 3 .
worst place ever the food was burnt and the rest was luke warm . .they should be ashamed of themselves . letting children run around the restaurant with silverware dropping it and screaming and yelling .
twice now they 've let me down at the islington store . i ordered parts that they said they would send from the queen street store and to come in the next day .
if you 're visiting from out of town , do n't bet on it . never have i seen a bar not accept an out of state id until i came here . so stupid
i went there at around 6 o'clock and it was n't very busy . instead of cleaning and making sure the condiment area was full they were n't doing anything . the floor was full of wrappers and food . they were out of napkins and ketchup .
these people are below average intelligence try to rip you off argue with you about specials posted on the menu board in the store ! had enough of them i do not have the time to teach basic common sense !
i gave one star because i do n't think you can give zero . sales rep came to our home & gave a good presentation .
i had the worst delivery experience of my life ! i was at my daughters new place helping her move in . this kfc is literally from google maps so 3 minute drive or 20 minute walk . we were tired and still doing stuff so we ordered food .
i used to frequent this place religiously because they honestly have one of the best sushi in markham . the love boat platters were my favorite and for take out you receive a 13 discount ( so no tax ) .
i went in for a front end alignment and that was ok , just ok .
i booked an appointment for walk-in by phone but when i got there , one of receptionists said i already went there earlier the day and then the only available time is two hours later if i want to see a doctor again .
i agree , my condition required me to go on medicare with humana gold plus and they do n't accept it .
i just went here and i 'm disappointed . the place has an ok selection of toppings not what i was expecting . the froyo was very watery and like an icy . the flavors were n't fresh .
probably one of the worst car rental location ! i have been standing here for at least an hour . the manager just walks back and forth arguing with people and it went from 4 of the customer services people down to 2 !
i wish it would let you rate 0 '' stars because that is what they deserve . the technician acted like our best friend but he was nothing but a scam artist . they must get some sort of kickback ? came to look at our ac unit .
this place is horrible ! just left the drive thru and waited 30+ minutes for nothing . by the time i pulled up to the window , i was n't even in the mood for tacos since i was pissed . i asked them what the hold up was .
every single time i go to this mcdonald 's they find a way to fuck up my order ; i 'm so tired of this lazy ass rude ass staff it 's ridiculous ‍
so this used to be one of my favourite joints , but in the last few months to half year it 's really gone downhill . i used to come in here daily but i just had my last experience sunday morning .
oh my god . worst service ever ! party of 10 in their private room . took an hour to get served a martini . totally incompetent waiter . manager tried to fix it by taking something off then forgot to do it . never even apologized .
our experience with this school has been terrible . our son was constantly harassed by a couple other students who would call him their girlfriend and grab him . the school did nothing other than talk to them .
i 'm waiting here after my boyfriend and i sign in at the podium . a lady signs in after us and says hi to the doctor , '' as the last patient leaves .
one star would be generous for this shit hole but it 's the lowest rating i can give . this place is an absolute train wreck .
food is good , but service is iffy . ate there a couple times on a recent trip to vegas . the last morning we were there , we were told there would be a 5-10 minute wait , and we were looking into a half empty restaurant .
lol , this place is a joke . apparently i did n't get annie , because my basic manicure did n't even include filing , cleaning under my nails , really any buffing , and she left streaks of polish across my nails .
i went to this salon and was initially impressed with the atmosphere but that 's all i found attractive to this business . i got a gel manicure that did n't even last a week .
absolutely the worst dry cleaner i have ever been to . every time i go in there i get hassled about something .
this is the worst petsmart i 've seen . we moved here and when i first called and made an appt just to get acquainted w the dr , they proceeded to tell me our baby was way overdue on a shot .
this place is crap the employees are rude and the food is just nasty . every single time its cold and they put the sandwiches together lackadaisical it is sad and hugely disappointing ! they truly need to get it together !
not my choice to even come to palace station for any reason but my friend wanted to go to the oyster bar . i actually heard really great things about it .
wifi does n't work here . also i find the service quality here is n't very good . i ordered the aroma white hot chocolate but got a regular hot chocolate mixed with a bit of white chocolate .
absolutely the worst customer service out of any shop out there . i went in for a standard oil change and the technician proceeded to rifle through my vehicle to try to upsell me for items that i knew i never needed .
ca n't believe this place is still in business . we recently moved to the area and were were trying out all the restaurants . we ended up here on our anniversary . the place was empty ( that should have been our first clue ) .
nvr again they do n't have half the cosmetics and not much hair dying or developer products and the cashier got mad cuz somebody left a brush and he thought it was mine trying to charge me . when i told him that 's not mad he huffed .
horrible customer service ! sent a package overnight , never go there in time . then called their customer service line , promised a refund of $ 250 . 4 weeks went by no refund and now they say its too late to get refund .
found myself here with a large group of college friends on a reunion , and i would gladly eat a bucket of hot monkey puke before stepping foot in the place again .
closed and out of business ! all photo jobs sent out to the customers .
after spending 20 minutes in the drive thru on my lunch hour and still having 8 cars in front of me needless to say i drove off and went elsewhere . i 'm sure it 's a staffing problem . get it together taco bell !
met a wonderful lady at the home and garden show . ( this lady explained alot ) but another lady showed up randomly with a snob attitude . she did n't explain anything to us and lied about some info i already knew . she has no customer experience .
scam ! this company takes your application fee and even if you get approved it wo n't go any further . please do not deal with yolanda especially
i 'm giving them one star due to the fact that my car was somewhat clean . i got the vip wash which really for the money i paid the work that was done was mediocre at best .
as soon as i walked in , there was two guys complaining about their order being incorrect . i should had trusted my gut and checked my pizza before going home . to my fault i trusted the employees , bad call .
not good at all . burger was a frozen patty for 13 dollars . my fiance asked for well done hashbrowns , they came out barely cooked and her sandwich was missing the cheese .
the service and food was a bit less than poor . the waitress took the order and the next time we saw her was to remove the dishes when we finished . we had received vouchers for dinner and my wife and i chose the salmon .
jimmy john 's is freaky fast , but not this location ! i wish i could give less than 1 star .
every surface in this venue is disgusting , dirty , sticky , nasty , and gross . this place has gone downhill for a while now , and after my visit on new years day , we will never go back .
ridiculous customer service , i yelp all businesses that i have any conflict with . my whole family has had bad service this location . business 's should always provide the customer with simple rules and great service .
almost always screw up my order and the food quality is poor . typically fry 's are cold and or soggy . the outside of the soft drink cups are always dripping wet because they do n't wipe them off .
lousy management team . ordered delivery . delayed over 2 hours . everytime we 'd call they 'd say driver on his way '' which was never the case . they did not even offer one word of apology .
very friendly staff . a little expensive for a meal . idk if the pizza is as expensive but my fettuccine alfredo with chicken with a combo was $ 18 ! i thought okay this has to be amazing if it 's this expensive . wrong .
when asked on their customer feedback form if i would suggest the hotel to others , i strongly would suggest they do n't .
lousy service , inept management , food is poor to mediocre . other than that a great place for lunch .
they never return calls , it has taken over 3 weeks to fix a basic plumbing problem with my fridge . if you use them anticipate holding there hand through the process and anticipate waiting on hold every time you call them . they are horrible !
this is a tourist trap . do not eat here . both meals that we ordered were absolutely disgusting . the calzone was totally undercooked .
i called because of a non-functioning electrical connection for my pool pump . the office person ( unbeknownst to me ) misunderstood the problem and sent two technicians who did nothing more than replace the breaker . they did not consult me .
in a shocking turn of events , the person who has been doing microblading here for 4 years departed to start her own business .
ridiculous , ordered a pizza at 10:00 pm ( i received my confirmation email ) pizza never came , no one answered the phones .
i went in there because my eyebrow lady was closed . i should 've stayed with my hairy eyebrows because now i have two different eyebrows that are thin as hell ! partially my fault for not letting her know i just wanted a clean up .
terrible . both orders were screwed up , steak was dry , toppings were forgotten , prices were wrong . bad service .
a few of us ordered a delivery to work . when i opened my steamy lunch combo , it was super greasy with a hair to boot . ( which i discovered only after my first two nibbles ) nice . i have never ordered from them since .
had dinner there last night , steak and lobster special for two , served cold , steak was shoe leather , lobster was like mush , vegetables were gritty with sand do n't chance it , so many better places than this !
bell trans ' waiting time was very lengthy from the airport to the hotel . we waited more than 30 minutes due to several people being ahead of us and it took more than an hour to get to the hotel after that .
i am incredibly dissatisfied with both the service and quality of food . i asked for curry shredded chicken on rice , and was given crispy chicken with tomato sauce .
came here for lunch and a drink , got the mimosa and fish tacos . the mimosa was okay but the fish tacos ( came in two ) were so bad .
this place evidently has been closed since the 17th of november for good . would have been nice if they had updated their website .
i do n't want to waste my time on writing a lengthy review , i 'll be short like the pharmacists here at the matthews location .
my husband has a huge sweet tooth and we are always on the lookout for new places . we love supporting local shops and we were excited to find this place , unfortunately we will not be returning customers .
the only reason i gave them 1 star is because there is no option for 0 . my order was messed up and when i called them they say that more money ! really if i order orange chicken and fried rice should n't i get that ?
worst slowest service of my life , wasted an hour here . overpriced too . not gon na be coming back .
had lunch with a friend and it was great . friend is doing well . took a different item for takeout ( chilli chicken ) and ate with sister . we both ended up with food poisoning .
terrible store . first time in , picked up crickets for my son . they guy filled the bag and blew into it and tied it off . unsurprisingly , the crickets were dead in 24hours .
went into this store 20 minutes before closing . the doors were open . normally i am very understanding of things being unavailable closer to closing , however the guy said that they were closed and out of everything .
my experience with this company was as a renter , and they were awful to deal with . it was rare that anyone ever responded to my phone calls , and every time a repair was needed , i had to call them repeatedly to get anything done .
poor customer service . promised to call back , did n't . i called them , said they 'd call back , did n't . when one pays for a service one expects just that . these folks have failed when it comes to customer service . no star !
i went to your location a couple days ago the older lady with the red hair was very hesitant to help me .
how can you advertise your event is open until 4 , allow me to purchase tickets online the day of the show , and then when i show up at 2 tell me you decided to close early ?
i went to exchange a chi blow dryer i 'd received as a gift for christmas for another color .
if i could give zero stars for the pharmacy i would . there 's a prescription my son needs that they rarely have in stock so i have to drive to one a lot farther away to get it .
they got a 1 star because a 1 4 star is n't possible ! spirit canceled our flight from las vegas to oakland without explanation and they did n't offer another flight that day or the next day .
first time in this place , we finally went out after waiting for more than 30 minutes for two plates . worst service i 've ever experienced in toronto .
by far the worst bww i have ever been to as far as the food goes . our server was lovely and kept our drinks filled but that was about the only positive part of our meal .
they opened over an hour late . people were standing outside waiting for the manager to come in . no customer service whatsoever
do not rent from this company . they will not refund your security or pet deposits .
the store is nicely laid out . everything is clean and well stocked . i 've shopped here many times . i also shop online . my challenge is that due to my 6 ' 5 '' frame i need the extra large sizes .
yuck . premade ravioli , premade tasteless goopy white sauce , premade tasteless red sauce . i do n't pay money for canned food with no seasoning .
very strange place but took 7 days to get results from xray and ultrasound to my doctor . not happy and wont be back .
circle k stores in tucson , arizona , have spoiled me as to what i expect from a convenience store .
do not come to this place ! stay away it 's a scam . we told them we were interested in the 2007 ford expedition el and they told my wife to fill out the application for financing .
we only went here because at check in they gave us a $ 20 coupon towards their buffet . we still paid $ 26 after coupon for 2 adults and one child for brunch . food was definitely all out of the freezer and put in the microwave .
normally if you 've been to one kohls , you 've been to them all , but today the service at this location really bothered me . i looked around the shoe department for a long time trying to find certain boots .
just saw the owner manager verbally berate her whole staff in front of the entire restaurant . most unprofessional thing i 've seen in any restaurant or retail environment . i feel bad for the staff- they were providing great service on christmas eve !
wtf 10 usd a month need my bank checking account ? hell no . here one of customer review : wish i had gone online to see reviews . short of it.i moved and did n't use the membership but still paid thru my contract .
i gave this place a couple of chances after they cut me a lot with the nail file . however , after getting my nails done here for a while they started to turn yellow and dark on the sides .
worst experience of my life . i will never step foot in this place again . my sales associate was great , no problem with that . it was the managers that left a bad taste in my mouth .
first off i have bad credit so my options were limited . someone told me to go to drive time because they work with people like me . they did accept me but the terms were unfavorable . again my choices were limited .
i ordered online and picked up the purses , got home and found four out of seven were defective . i brought it back to exchange for the same exact products but they will not do it .
i 've spent a lot of money and time in home depots and this is one i will never step foot in again ! no thank you .
still no help from fulton on warranty mistakes which the subcontractors have agreed to fix . it 's just so wrong . lesson to myself , read yelp reviews before buying !
do not order from this place . i ordered online and it said my pizzas would be delivered in 25 min . it took almost an hour . tried to call them and no one would answer the phone . pizza was cold and tasted old .
first and last time ordering food from here . i placed a to-go order of pad sew eww ( mild ) and chicken basil ( medium spice level ) . within 35 minutes of consuming , i had a severe stomach ache .
went in here to get 1 lane to bowl a couple games with my wife and a friend for my birthday around 7 on a friday . there had to have been 10 lanes open , at least .
this rating is based on fridays for the past 6 months , when i need to make multiple transactions . the staff is ok but knowingly it will be a busy day why would you only have two tellers when there is 6 windows available !
we went here in a saturday and try to get a table of 7 . the girl inside the door was so dam rude . she act like who are you and if you did n't reserve you can leave . no chance for a table .
my wife and i were angry after a trip here . i was not allowed to be present during the ultrasound of our baby because the person doing the ultrasound felt uncomfortable due to her religious beliefs .
terrible . you 'll be left on the dock with no boat ! we had reserved a pontoon boat 2 months in advanced and had confirmed the reservations multiple times through phone and email the week before . our name was on the schedule .
terrible service ! we never saw our waitress after our order was placed . someone else served our entree . my husbands bottle beer was warm ! we both would have ordered another drink but never saw the waitress .
i am sorry to say that i was very displeased with dr. daulat and his staff . had to call and follow up on progress toward a referral specialist 3 times over 2 + weeks .
if i could give less than 1 star i would , the food is subpar . however the most annoying thing was its advertise as 13.99 after 10 , there was a catch and the waitress charged us 20 out the door . she was also extremely unpleasant .
originally had a driving lesson on wednesday with tammy at 9 am , 30 mins passed and no one showed up . called the school to let them know and they said they switched my lesson to another time without informing me .
got nail fungus here on my toe . they do not clean tubs out with any kind of cleaner , they just rinse out .
very unprofessional in more than one way tried to cancel wedding that was 6 months out after paying deposit an paying for part of wedding it self was told that i would n't get any money back after leaving 3 messages .
not for children ! its a haunted house place trying to act like a festival . not a fall festival ! after spending $ 36 to get in , it was horrible . mud up to your ankles . the fun house was scary for my kids .
spouse just out of surgery and not supposed to be up for long periods . waited in first waiting room 30 minutes . now in another room waiting for consult . horrible . less booking . less greed people .
we were told that this was a very nice restaurant with great seafood however we had a server with an attitude and entrée was just passable . we were not told any of the specials or even our servers name . sorry i do n't think will be back .
horrible service . they have messed up my order twice . i had to call customer service and complain and they kept messing up my order . it 's no complicated to read an order when making a sandwich .
7:45 on a saturday night , and they were n't that busy . we waited 15 minutes and no one even acknowledged our presence . we 've eaten here several times before , but that 's not acceptable . we left and found somewhere else to spend our money .
the worse treatment ! first time here ! the office is hard to find it ! call & answer machine will pick up ! try to call for directions & when i got there no even good morning ! how may i help u !
i walked out , not willing to pay $ 50.00 for just the steak . sams town is not a high end casino . the buffet is the only reasonable sit down restaurant . the line was 1 and 1 2 .
horrible customer service ! walked in on a saturday afternoon & there were several workers and we were the only customers yet no one said hello or offered help .
i came here for breakfast on the way to work . the service was hilariously slow . the workers had no sense of urgency and seemed to feel like they were there to chat . the breakfast sandwich was brutal - egg was disgusting & bagel was soggy .
this gym is so small for the price we are paying this place should be upgraded . plus no women 's gym .
probably the worst pho i 've ever had . dropped in for a quick lunch with my mom and we both ordered brisket and tendon pho .
mediocre wings , salad , frites and service . service was nothing special . i guess with the great weather today , the servers rather be sitting on the patio having a beer than serving on the patio . employees looked tired and miserable .
spent a hour calling and ended up in a phone automated loop and nobody answered . this does not build much confidence when i rent and i need assistance to get put into a loop .
do not support this business ! these puppies are all from mills and almost everyone i know that has a puppy from here was sick and or passed away within two days . the staff will do anything to keep your money .
having recently moved here i went here based off of other reviews and would not go back ever again . my manicure was rushed and i have had a mani several times before and never as poorly as this .
usually i would have written a review of flying colours for gals considering it is a favourite for me and my girlfriend , but tonight we went out for a late night bite and got a couple roles .
fucken bad ! the girls do n't even know how to dance they just kinda walk around the pole and drinks are so expensive we paid 50 bucks for 2 drinks literally without alcohol . garbage place ! $ 45 per person to get in .
so let me just say i never ever write reviews but i 'm so upset at the customer service i received at this location it 's ridiculous !
very disappointed ! saw an ad for this place and was very excited to try it . this is the kind of place i 've been waiting for around here . checked the hours and it said in the ad they are open sunday 's .
i was very disappointed with the food and the service . my daughter ordered a dish that was over salted so we sent it back and asked for pho . they brought it out and didnt bring toppings .
this was our first time ordering here . we got a simple deep dish chicago style pizza with pepperoni and onion and got it delivered . when it arrived the pizza was not hot at all , not cold but barely luke warm .
since we 've moved in our ceiling has been leaking and they 've fixed '' it every other month . not worth the price . two pools but they 're small . i would look somewhere else !
disgusting food and she was dishonest about how much it cost ! we ordered 22 pupusas and they came in less than 10 minutes ! my mom makes pupusas and i assure you that it takes sooo much longer to make them .
this place absolutely sucks . it was pretty dead when my date and i sat at the bar and had our first drink . we paid $ 70 each to enter . 12:00 rolled around and there still was n't much going on .
i absolutely would not use this company again after speaking with the manager , sherry , about the work they did on my exterior signs . i would post a photo on facebook , but these signs reflect poorly on my business !
i just counted and there are 14 people in front of me and 1 teller at the window . i do n't need people asking me what i need help with when i walk in the door . i need faster service .
checked in with the general manager and he was not friendly at all ! if the gm is n't friendly then i doubt anyone else here is
absolutely the worst hotel experience ever . the manager is a good guy , but that still does n't excuse the type of establishment this place is . zero stars .
horrible experience . would not recommend to anyone . just go somewhere else for you dentistry needs . trust me .
this place is stupid and has incompetent workers . just left there with my boyfriend . we went to be social with his brother and girlfriend , and were basically asked to leave because we werent smoking .
went to talk to mike today . ( he was recommended from my cousin after doing a custom piece for her . ) long story made short , he did n't want to work . i was open to anything and have the money .
it 's like they are trying to make the ghetto look classy . but , a ghetto with new bed dressing and a half assed paint job is still a ghetto .
there is no reason to use this company . they mistakenly '' overcharged our card by thousands of dollars for a $ 500 trip and have done very little to rectify it to date . i would not recommend this service to anyone .
joined smart gym when it first arrived for the purpose of group classes . these classes were always full of members . always . one wonders why such a decision was made . its the stupidity of the management .
this restaurant went out of business which i knew would happen . they are n't temporary closed due to renovation . word out in the streets and other restaurants near by there done .
horrible customer service . every time i have gone there the wait gets longer and longer . this evening i was the only car in the drive-thru .
employees are extremely slow have no idea what they 're doing . never coming back here again . too many bad experiences to be excused for .
the manager , paul , was extremely rude when i came in to spend $ 90 on gift cards . i walked out and went to a different store instead . i will never come here again .
caveat - i did not eat here , nor will i return to do so . i arrived before my friends and tried to snag a table outside .
decent but not great . staff typically seems rushed . got my eye brows waxed and the wax was way too hot , my skin literally peeled off . i do n't go here anymore .
first of all let me say that this mcdonalds does n't have a sign in their drive thru stating that they charge for ranch . second of all customer service sucks here .
i made a yelp account just to write this review . i ordered the potato bacon , it might as well should have been called the starch and flavorless .
was told to be at the appointment at 1:30 for a 2:00 appt . when i arrived on time the door was locked . at ten to 2 the door was unlocked . i was n't seen by the dr for another 45 minutes .
expensive snacks on a roof deck with no view or atmosphere . or service . the kids with biergarten tshirts were too busy talking with each other ( sitting at their own table ) to realize the rest of us wanted to eat , drink , or pay tabs .
this was certainly the worst experience of my life with an airline .
i found the sales staff to be quite rude and unhelpful . there were not enough people working at the cutting station so the line was long . there was no staff available to ask questions to ; i could not find anyone when i looked .
the non emergency line is absurd . i have called in several times to voice noise complaints and i remain on hold for 30+ minutes !
slowest service ever . sat at our table waiting for so long ended up just having to leave .
i have never been humiliated they way maria did . i ordered my meals and a $ 3.00 coke ( refillable ) . when i took my cup to be refilled i was told it would be an additional 50 cents .
ship your stuff any other way you can , you will be frustrated with the service from the drivers and the non existent customer service . what a joke
go somewhere else . you will wait 45-60 minutes to see someone . the dr will spend about 30 seconds with you with his hand on the door tying to leave .
they rarely answer the phone . they use the excuse that they are working in the back . i do n't feel that 's a reasonable answer . it 's bad business . they lost my vacuum i left to have repaired for a while , then was found .
i came one night past 10pm . sushi on bloor was closed so i decided to try this establishment out . what a mistake ! i order salmon lover ( $ 9 before tax ) and the quantity was so little .
pizza was very late , cold and soggy . worst pizza experience ever . you would think you could n't screw up pizza . how hard is it to get 1 2 mile before it gets cold . never again .
nevada state bank is now gouging it 's customers with a minimum balance fee '' of $ 7.50 per month . the little guy '' is being robbed , monthly , for keeping his small savings in this bank .
worst chipotle i 've ever been to in my life . i get that they are fairly new , but come on . get it together . the line goes sooooooo slow , the portions are the smallest i 've ever seen at chipotle .
went here for a year they are nice and facilities seem ok but their products are not clean . they also have so many new girls who do n't know what they are doing so stay away !
always love ruby tuesdays but this location was the worst experience in my life .
i rarely complain . this place needs better management and better trained employees . if someone takes your order , begins the crepe and finishes cooking it .
horrible ! came here on suggestion from my bf 's sister . the waitress spilled a drink on a member of our party . that was the first bad thing . service was lacking . wrong size juice was brought . water never came .
this is a patient mill . i brought my girlfriend here because she was having complications after having a surgery . they tried to convince her to make them her designated pcp as she was still filling paperwork .
i went to the store to purchase a printer , computer desk & office chair , have them delivered and assembled at my home .
i wanted to reschedule my appointment that was 3 weeks away but they charge 5 dollars just for changing the appointment unless you came in person . what an absurd policy .
oh evil sprint very dishonest company sprint is . they have ruined my credit and i have never had a sprint account . bad bad evil sprint .
we got our car from this place six months and 15 days ago . our cars engine exploded and had to be totalled out because they did n't disclose all the information about this vehicle .
i ca n't even begin to express my disgust in dealing with the brick . the salesperson promises you the world , and then no one cares once you pay ! they outsource everything . different contractors for delivery , installation , repairs , warranty .
do not take your car here . please see my bbb complaint about them . they are unprofessional and will have your car much longer than they say they will . prepare to be hung up on and lied to after they get your car .
today i went to grab a beer at twin peaks with a buddy , great clean store , and great layout but i was really put off . after we were served and given our bill , i gave my server a $ 20 bill .
i got a gel manicure a couple of days ago and already the polish has chipped on multiple nails . the polish is uneven , faded and messy around my nail bed .
i usually dont do the bad reviews at all . but here when we get in there , there was a girl with a red hair , she was so rude to us and she had toooo much attitude .
this would have been 4 or 5 stars , but they were unbelievably , unbearably slow . check in , check out , room service , and even reception took forever to pickup . they have great rooms , but left really bad first and last impressions .
i had 3 drinks without even a minor buzz and i 'm a petite girl . typically 1 well-made mojito and im done . what does that tell you . the menu says happy hour all drinks discounted - score ! get the check , i 've been punked .
if you use this pharmacy bring a sleeping bag and a lunch . this is the worst pharmacy ever they have the worst service and even worse attitudes .
i will never come back here . they could n't understand how to make a mocha frappe with hazelnut flavor . once that was finally figured out , i overheard that they had spilled my drink dumping half the contents out .
rude the car guy walked away in the middle of our conversation , the car was left with sand all over the dash , and it was dirty all over . more dirt blown in car than removed . no vacuum on the side by the door frame carpet .
complete and utter waste of a $ 30 burger . ordered the kobe beef burger on a whole wheat bun , grilled portobello mushrooms , caramelized onions , and brie .
absolutely do not go to this location . such a joke !
worst experience ever . i will avoid this location forever . first they allow me to order a chocolate turnover but do n't have any . we waited 10 minutes ( in the drive-thru ) for the order .
this was the worst italian food we have had . the pasta had no flavor , tasted like chalk . the wine was gallo . be prepared . we left most of our meal and walked without take out boxes . waste of money !
this store is just nasty , i did n't have a bad experience or anything i just had to yelp that it is unnecessarily filthy ! not mess , trashy , or dirty but disgusting has not ever been cleaned i think .
the price always changes when you return a car . i use business codes to get cars cheaper , and no matter what they always try to void them upon returning the car . they will also break contract and charge more than what you agree to pay .
just disappointing quality of food . spent 35 dollars on nasty nachos and quesadillas . how do you mess up nachos !
i 've eaten here 3 times in the last 2 months and the food was terrible and not hot , wings where dry and service was n't very good at the bar area .
dirtiest place ever ! the blinds were filthy the floor ! the service sucked ! they forgot half of my order they mest everything up . but one thing they didnt forget was my check . .never going there again
be careful ! you will be billed for services you did not get . months after service , expect a bill with a list of items you can not even pronounce . what is your option then ?
very disappointed in the service today . we found a hair in our food and they did n't seem to care . no discount no apology nothing . we as a family come here often and finding a hair in our breakfast was the most disgusting thing .
terrible looking dive bar with rude waitstaff and bartender . food is terrible and the service was just as bad . with so many places nearby do n't waste your time at this crappy place .
after a meal of pizza and wings , we thought we 'd get some dessert and decaf coffee . the waitress took our order , and came back to let us know they did not have decaf .
my husband picked up a teriyaki bowl from here last weekend and said the beef tasted strange while he was eating it . several hours later he definitely had food poisoning .
worst service ever ! we had reservations and were seated right away but we waited 20 minutes for water , a menu , bread , table set-up , and a server . when he finally showed up , he had the nerve to ask how 's it going ? ''
go to another location . do n't eat here ! literally the worst tropical smoothie location in arizona . the cashiers must be from the hills have eyes casting or they just are stoned beyond belief . they mumble and avoid eye contact every time i order .
horrible customer service . the saga continues to fix errors made on my account . no one has any initiative to take ownership and fix it . i 've been passed along again and again .
first time here . maybe coffee is not their thing . my americano was terrible . could n't drink it . i like supporting places like these rather than hitting up starbucks for my caffeine fix . too bad .
wow . i am a long time fan and customer but will never go back to this location . ridiculously rude incompetent crew .
this place is dirty and they are just churning people out while they make sloppy coffees . totally overpriced for a d grade coffee . i had a $ 6 dry cappuccino which was full to the top with milk and he screamed out , dry ! dry ! ''
i just called and try to ordered a pizza , worst customer service . so i 'm taking my business elsewhere
just went there for my lunch and ordered steak tacos to go . i got charged for two steak tacos , but when i got to work it was chicken tacos .
i 'm well traveled and this was the worst hotel room i 've ever stayed in . dirty air vents , uncomfortable bed , and it was the first time i 've ever found bugs in my room .
it 's odd that they referred this place as newly remodeled . true the lobby furniture was fairly fresh but that seems to be where it ends . carpets throughout were dirty and the rooms had an odor .
gordon ramsey needs to save his own kitchen . the burgers and fries we got were less than subpar . they were room temperature and the fries were barely warmer than that . not worth the money at all . save your time and money and go somewhere else .
i had terrible customer service at this location yesterday . my daughter wanted to by a bra that had a sign with a picture of the same bra and it said $ 29.99 .
awful process . had to wait for a cup of coffee after paying . need to pour plain coffee when you pay like starbucks does . we want starbucks back !
updating my review based off of my last 4 months of residency here . if there is a repair you want done , do n't expect it to be done unless its very important .
this is by far the worst and most shady brand name dealership i have ever dealt with and i would highly recommend that no one ever deals with them for any reason .
i read the reviews and am confused as to why the majority of them are good . i travel quite a bit for work and have eaten at many chinese buffets . this place was one of the worst i 've eaten at .
ordered a benedict . eggs were hard . asked for new ones . took 45 minutes . never again .
i came in for a simple order for me and a couple of friends , nothing fancy , just a few tenders and some fries .
dishonest is the first word that comes to my mind .
i love chipotle but just had the worst experience . the line out the door is normal but is it normal to have two chipotle employees try to cut you in line ?
i went here to replace a watch battery which they charged about $ 40 for . i thought it seemed pricey but i did n't know where else to go . i took another watch there to get some links removed and they wanted to charge $ 25 .
i had a bad experience here . they did n't tell me they have a $ 3,000 fee for giving birth at their birth center . i sent them a message about my disappointment when they told me the price about a week after my first appointment with them .
hands down the worst hotel i 've ever stayed at . i for once was eager and excited to go on a work trip . my second week back from maternity leave and had to travel , could n't wait for a full nights rest in a hotel room .
sent out to buy lunch for the entire office from louisiana chicken only to find out they closed . well not exactly closed , the sign on the door that greeted us said they failed to pay their lease .
good product but owner is not very nice . not friendly , not welcoming & makes u wait the window even if there 's no customer . his employees are nice though .
i really hope this place makes it . i tried the curry , however , it tasted more like a pineapple gravy ( no hint of curry flavor ) . it was sweet , not spicy as it was described .
extremely horrible customer service ! my boyfriend and i were looking for a specific wine . my bf had to use the restroom so i continued to look . soon , he came back upset because letty would not let him use the restroom !
well my ice cream was very freezer burned and horrible i ca n't eat it , it 's that bad . when i called after bringing it home and trying the young lady said there was nothing she could do . i wo n't be back to your establishment .
worst internet provider . too bad we ca n't go anywhere else due to the monopoly they have in tempe . we have high speed internet yet it goes down for hours multiple times within a day . today was the last straw .
terrible service , very unorganized . we had been waiting for over an hour only to see the other table who came in later got their food served first . even worse , the waitresses looked like they did n't care at all .
i am having a bad experience with them . i feel .like they have stolen my money and abused my trust . so my story is that i only wanted a few sessions of laser and therefore no contract and they gave me their session by session prices .
probably should have read the reviews first . i 've always driven by this place so i thought i 'd give it a try . took a shirt in for a simple hem alteration .
i have had so much better canes chicken way better then this place chicken could have cooked . longer tea was nice fries were great but chicken was just ok so disappointed i thought it would be great . because the reviews
i went because i got free buffet tickets with my stay . the first time , i tried dinner . bland food , very few choices . the second time , i went to breakfast . the butter they had near the pancakes was a huge mistake .
they do n't even deserve to be in business . would not honor a coupon and complained that they never should have issued them . rude and i would n't recommend this bowling alley to anyone .
our server was not trained well , wings came out slightly warm if not cool in temperature . our one pound boneless chicken wings where of two clearly different quantities and our server argued with me that they were the same .
used stuart for a little over a year and they did a pretty good job . scorpions decreased and things were getting better . when we no longer needed his services we cancelled .
i give zero stars but have to put 1 , this place is a dump and the power is very unprofessional , he left paying customers standing waiting for more than 10min , than refuses to honor a discount . they will not get another dollar .
will not come back . food is average but the service is terrible . the pho is not impressive but ok and their egg rolls are made from refrigerated product with some unrecognizable stuff inside ! the service is among the worst i 've ever experienced .
worst fatburger ever . honestly , it took about 30 mins to get 2 milkshakes . a lot of the customers in the restaurant seemed unhappy with their service .
this place does n't deserve a star , but had to click for comment to post ! what a rip-off ! what i ordered was n't the same as pictured in the filipino newspapers .
another sucking appliance company . lousy service unprofessional have no clue what they are doing . do n't use them . they came and said parts have to replaced n they will order the parts . it 's now over a month and i have not heard from them .
horrible location with horrible customer service wo n't be back ever to this location . horrible altitude for asking a simple question . so unacceptable from the women helping me .
pros : good miso soup , decent prices cons : mushy edamame , inconsistent roll sizes with some far too large , fishy smell and taste , screaming orgasm '' sauce on the oh rolls looks like oily water mixed with chunks of mayo .
absolute worst massage and service i have ever experienced . do not go here ! staff was unprofessional and cold mannered . they made me feel more like an annoyance than a paying customer .
horrible er visit . my mother came in with extremely high blood pressure . no one even bothered to measure her blood pressure for the next six hours . we have been waiting for the doctor to read the test results '' for hours .
purposely misdiagnosed my grandfather 's throat cancer as a sore throat . my grandfather died 6 months later . would not recommend .
this pedicure lasted 13 minutes . and that time is including the time it took to put 3 coats of paint on my toes . no rub at all . paint job sub par . he had to turn off the massage when he started to paint .
unfortunately , since this fab store is closing , they could care less about their customers . they will tell you that you can return something even though they will be closing soon . and they wo n't honor this policy .
this place is a scam . they told me that my car 's struts were leaking and wanted to charge me $ 750 to have them changed . i took the car to another mechanic and they told me the struts were fine .
omg this place is terrible on a wednesday night . the drinks are over priced and the girls are ugly with little boobs . maybe it 's just the day of the week but i mean wtf . they are now called the horse ''
the quality of their work has definitely gone down . i was initially drawn to them because they could do a variety of nail styles '' which i prefer to the standard french tip that 's so popular in north phoenix .
in the tradition of full disclosure , i never really liked quiznos that much anyway . .i 'm more of a firehouse or harris teeter hoagie guy , but the other day i was hungry on lunch and decided to give them a try .
old and rundown carpet is old they do n't do any gardening on the ground it looks a mess the upside is the house a kitchen area in the room and they have a good quality shower curtain most hotels use the real cheap ones .
really bad service and food . i ordered the duck noodle soup and one cup bubble milk tea . the noodle soup is bad taste and the milk tea is much over price . the bubble tea is just like water .
wir haben hier versucht , im kleinen kreis einen geburtstag zu feiern .
no unlimited apps is a joke tried to bring my wife to eat and both buy in a share but you can not share at all !
takes 20 min to get food during lunch and order is wrong . i think i 'll try nothing but noodles instead next time . service is good though .
the only thing good about this place is the cold beer . went for dinner one night during the week waited for 10 minutes before seated at a table . finally the bartender told us to just seat ourselves .
what a dream it has been renting from this management company . just check out the amazing photos .
slow service , items on their reverse happy hour menu online are outdated and they no longer honor them , and ca n't review food because it took too long for our order to come out so we left . we will not be going back .
i was really bored ! some parts were slightly entertaining . it was a very expensive nap . i would not recommend this to anyone at the current cost , i might pay 20.00 to see it if there was nothing on tv .
although service is good , food is ok. our meat was hard and rubbery . chicken was hard as a rock . sad because the service is exceptional . wo n't be coming back .
prepare for a long wait , poor customer service and god forbid you have to use the restroom while you wait 30+ minutes ! unfortunately there is nothing good i can say about tw cable .
unbelievable ! instead of stay in line i stepped out side to get pocket change then wanted to step inside to ask banker question . he locked door just in from of my nose ! that is a banking management and they want our money ?
got my car washed for the quickly one for $ 3 and it was n't worth it . my car came out still dirty plus they broke my car antenna , now i ca n't play my radio in the car anymore .
wife had her foot crushed and in terrible pain . very slow service , no sense or urgency and no care about her well being . will go down to banner gilbert hospital next time .
what a crap hole . i stopped here twice to give it a try , both times nobody came out to help me i even sat around for a bit last time . no thanks , never again
went in to get a refill on a prescription for nerve damage . paid them $ 150 cash for them to tell me they could n't write the script for a medicine i have to have every day .
one hour my ass . got there saturday before noon and got told i would n't get it until monday . if you need something same day , do n't bother .
one star for not being open when they should . they say they are open till 3 am and today when i was there by around 2 am , they were closed and they cook gestured me that they are closed .
i can no longer stand looking at the 5 star reviews for this place .
this branch is a poor representation of bank of scotland . i have never had an issue outside of this branch with the company , but have used this branch 3 times and encountered three issues , always with international affairs .
do n't take your car here . they gave us the run around in terms of time . very unorganized . there are far better local businesses to support .
first off let me start off with this place being super sketchy . it looks like a place that would give u a happy ending ( not sure if that 's a good or bad thing ) .
this sushi restaurant is sub par . the rice in the sushi is not fresh . i recommend sushi loca or sushi fever .
my family and i have been going to this restaurant ever since it opened years ago . we were never a fan of the owner because we thought she was rude but we kept going back because we enjoyed the food .
do not stay here . all the bad reviews are true . do not stay here . sleep in a rental car . sleep at the airport . do not stay here . stains everywhere . the smell was god-awful . do not stay here . nothing works .
love shoeless in oshawa and love shoeless in ajax . have now tried this location in whitby 3 times and all 3 times it was awful . we live in whitby but will either go to oshawa or ajax then go here .
please do not rent here if you have a family . not safe . my car was shot up new year 's day and loud music plays all night with security picking and choosing who gets away with things . drug related activities everywhere .
we decided to try the gamblers special last night at mr lucky 's . what a disappointment . the restaurant had 3 tables with customers when we arrived at 5:30pm our server took our order and we were looking forward to our meal .
over priced . a basic acrylic fill and pedi ended up being $ 120 . and my nails looked terrible within a few days . french manicure lines were very uneven . acrylic chipped too easily . staff not super friendly either .
food is mediocre at best ; customer service is absolute sh t. ordered a chicken souvlaki , arrived with no chicken in it .
had a really bad experience here . bought 5 items on there holiday sale . three never shipped , although my credit card was charged . i had to basically chase them down on the phone ( which they never answer ) for days to get an response .
we contacted & left messages 3 times for these people and no one responded . clearly they do n't need new customers .
the guy in there is always rude . if you give me an attitude as i walk into your shop you can be assured i wo n't be spending any money and will probably walk right out .
stay a way from this shit hole . waited over 30 min for a quesadilla . while everybody else in my group got there food at different times .
been here on and off since it opened . i dealt with their weekend grave guy at a different bar and was u happy with him , but gave him another chance .
went last night with my gf to have a drink and gamble a little bit . i guess the gm 's were there behind the bar . they checked our id 's and verified we were old enough to be there .
nice salon but the worst customer service . i would drive a little further 67th happy valley .
once you do n't get the blonde girl with a mohawk who never smiles then it is ok for a beer . if you do get her just leave because she is so rude
half the pumps are out of order . receipts do n't print . bathrooms out of order . price gouging on gas . no reason to stop here . move on !
my husband is allergic to onions and they put everything on his sandwich . this is like the 5th time . horrible . i hate having to live by this location
i was hoping to finally try this place and then i see people outside taking orders in over 110 degree weather not ok . i refuse to support i business seeing people having to be outside like that .
screw this place . i had a groupon for mani , pedi , and mini facial and i called to schedule it today ( june 15 ) and she told me they are booked on weekends until august 6 .
terrible . no x-rays , minimal exam , and bare bones . i opted not to have my back moved after the dr seemed to know little as to why i had it . i went to another chiropractor who did a thorough exam and x-rays .
i went for my anniversary dinner . i really wanted beef ribs and it 's close so i thought lets go . the food was horrible . stay away . i got the beef ribs and they where served burned like charcoal and mash potato 's where ice cold .
i took out their food for several times untill one time i got sour tofu which went bad already in my meal .
the hostess and id checker were very helpful in helping us chose a good tequila , that is the only nice thing i 'll say about this place . the 2 bartenders ladies were unfriendly and unhelpful , ( just plain snotty ) .
the food here is very undercooked . servers are friendly but the food is not worth the price . we wo n't be returning to this location .
i wish i could give it no stars . orders wrong and creepy delivery guy . substitute your food for like items when they run out of things . then tell you as they deliver . will never go there again . wouldnt recommend to starving children .
i sent a couple emails for some non-emergency electrical work on a few switches and outlets as part of a larger renovation i am doing . i specifically mentioned the 5 star yelp rating .
very disappointing . unprofessional . did not read the directions for fingerprinting for an out of state license . i had to destroy card and request a new one . they are more expensive than a place i used in the past that was very professional .
do n't go there . we called ahead made 2 appointments for our kids waited 20 min after our time . they let people with out a appointment go ahead .
not a good first experience . pizza had no flavor , garlic sauce on bread sticks ran onto all our pizza boxes . very long line and customer were very angry . they literally picked up and hung up on multiple customer 's . talk about bad customer service .
do n't get me wrong beer nice cold . .but 2 blonde employees working their til 12am all they talked about , complains about customers while we 're listening made me very uncomfortable
after having a horrific experience at the 16th location . ( horrific as in almost gave me the wrong meds and killed me , but being a forgiving person i let it go ) i decided that the 24th st would be my home base .
i 've tried this place on more than one occasion . unfortunately i will not be returning . i 've had multiple issues from my juices tasting bad the day after getting them and also found a piece of glass in one of the juices .
we go there for date night and ask to sit outside . they take our id away to make sure we do n't dash and run '' . that 's classy !
i purchased a vehicle from adventure july 13 ' . i recently sold the vehicle and had gap coverage on my loan . i was due a refund because i did n't hit maturity of the loan . i called them 2 times and left 2 messages .
was super hungry and the family was feeling for mexican . tried this place and it was the worst food ever . the taquitos were blan my combo plate had no taste taco bell is better than this place save your money and go elsewhere
rates as one star , terrible customer service via communication with office and dispatch . work was never checked and lock not properly working after tech left .
if there was a an option to give zero stars i would 've picked it and left it at that but i have never been so tempted to walk out in my entire life . the quality was horrible .
amateurs that 's what they are ! they will hassle you like you stop in a kiosk at the mall !
was completely shocked today when the girl serving us was wearing flip flops ! then not one but two more workers including the person who cooked our food was also wearing flip flops ! in the kitchen !
took our kids and grandson here on a sat night early , 5:30 , as a second choice in the area and was terribly disappointed . although seated quickly , everything 's went downhill after that . slow service in spite they were not busy .
i was here for dinner on a monday night , so it was n't busy , yet the service was more than terrible . the host was miserable - i do n't think she spoke to me and she definitely did n't smile .
horrible service ! i have never waited so long for food in a drive through ! i would have left if i was n't blocked in by other cars .
there is something wrong when you try and use a shared branching system and you are told that you are second rate and will have to wait for all the other customers who are members to be helped before you will be helped
horrible experience would not recommend anybody . if you want a drive through spa service then this is the place . mani pedi shellac . i was in and then i was out like literally minutes . my shellac gel polishes came right off after a few days .
paid for them to wash and dry car and do and express clean of the tires . they left soap on the car . i can see plenty of water spots , and they did n't even do the tires .
i am an entertainer and i wear several pairs of character ballroom dance shoes . i had 2 pairs i needed stretched badly before a rather important gig .
why do they call this the hawaiian marketplace ? nothing hawaiian in here . being hawaiian born , i was immediately displeased walking into this dump . old , grungy , with cheap souvenir junk . stay away . outside and dreadful during the hot summer months .
he may be good at cutting hair , but this is undeniably a horrifying experience to go through after growing out your natural hair for years to have it bleached and turn out like this .
horrible service ! same mexican guy always working. never says hello or goodbye just asks what you want in broken english . sooooooooo annoying !
0 stars ! they are killers ! took a cat in and he was put down in 24 hours . they said he had a medical condition '' yet did n't even do bloodwork .
yawn . we arrived early , and the music was decent . then , the dj started flipping the song every 30 seconds . both times i have visited they did this ! so irritating . will never go back unless forced .
sadly , the quality of their food has gone downhill . the chicken for the chicken katsu was pounded so thin that all i tasted was breading . come on , chicken thighs are n't that expensive ! and the breading was burnt !
arrived at 5:50 on a friday with an estimated wait time of close to an hour we were lucky to get a place at the bar . the bartender was great and seemed to know the menu but that 's when things went downhill . very expensive for chinese .
this is the worst music store ever ! they overcharge for lessons and have no clue about musical instruments . they also sell inferior products and often the wrong item to customers . do not waste your time or money at this place !
we ordered delivery and was greatly disappointed ! chicken fingers were horrible and my philly steak was soggy and nasty . when i called back to complain staff was very rude and said no one ever complains and that is what a philly is .
bad service ! understaffed , kitchen staff with no hair nets , and cold food . ribs and chicken were burned on the bottom . salad served before meal while our dishes sat on the counter getting cold because the server forgot to get the salad out earlier .
slow slow slow , why in the name of god is a express lane not used for people simply dropping something off or taking a drug test . .worst management of customer time i have seen . if you are coming here pack a lunch !
the absolute worst and most confusing game to play especially with paper version . this my first time playing bingo in nevada . this is the absolute worst experience that i ever had out of 20 years .
they just called me again too . they keep calling and i have told the guy of the bad experience that i had . i went to the old indian school location for a windshield replacement . they have since moved to cave creek road .
the only consistent thing about the loose moose is the horrible customer service . the food is passable and the beer selection is decent , but where they really shine is the lack of customer skills in their servers .
completely disappointed . brisket sandwich . tough , cold , horrible taste . something seemed quite wrong with this sandwich . greasy ff . i know ff should be a bit greasy , as they are friend , but the oil was old , rancid tasting .
omg , the food service is the worst ! the greeter was so rude , snotty attitude . why does it take 30 minutes to serve fries & 2 sliders from the lunch menu ? the restaurant wasnt crowded at all , their kitchen was just slow .
dump . bus from airport never on time . rude folks answering phone at front desk . sh '' thole .
had the worse phone order experience .
absolutely the worst hotel i have ever stayed at ! smallest room , most uncomfortable bed , the paint was falling off the walls , our bathroom door would n't close , the a c made the worst high pitched noise . i can honestly go on for ever !
do not recommend ! services are not as described and all of the staff members we dealt with are not knowledgeable of company policy . expect flights to be late delayed and overall experience to be very disorganized and chaotic .
i would not recommend taking the time to find out if the food has improved . sad . the owner should read the reviews and figure out what is going on . the crust was limp and the sauce was scarce .
as a hopeful customer , i called to get a quote to have some painting done in my home and was really disappointed to learn that these guys only do half or whole house paint jobs .
what we expected was very different from what we got . the service was unsatisfactory and the food was unacceptable . for example on the menu for one of the combos the description says there is rice and variety of different sashimi .
appetizers & drinks were good , but pricey . dinner was horrible and very expensive . i had the stuffed shrimp which was way over cooked & served barely warm . i sent it back to have it microwaved .
i have been to 24 hr laundry mats before and always had an attendant this one no attendant so if you use a machine and unknowingly it do n't work but your money is in the machine and nobody to service the machine and or do a refund !
do not use these people . i was quite excited when i found them for sheer convenience . i requested an initial visit and on going bi weekly services . the woman was very glad to take my business and my payment information immediately .
i probably would have given it more stars , except the staff ignores anything that might be a problem . while we getting ready to eat , a little boy threw up on the floor ( admittedly , it was mostly clear , but still . )
the idea of a club based on a cheesey movie . i have no idea why i had to check this place out . probably because i was drunk .
one day i 'll come back to explain the one star but i really do n't feel like writing an essay right now . save yourself the headache .
this is the worst pizza place ever . they were rude when we called to complain and did n't want to make anything better . chuck e cheese and frozen pizzas are better than their tasteless awful cardboard pizzas .
this sushi place is in a chinese strip mall . the quality is sub par and the staff was not very nice .
my husband and i were hopeful for their bubble tea since it 's so close to us , but we were sadly disappointed .
i am a customer here and ups store customer for the past 4 years and i walked in at an extremely busy time today and was embarrassed for the employees at how poorly the owner , matt , handled himself under stress .
wth , our water and diet pepsi glasses sat empty for like an hour . tried three times to ask for a refill and some nachos and she walks away every time . finally i 'm ticked off and she asks if i 'd like a refill .
worst service i 've ever experienced ! the waitress was so rude . im not going to come back here again !
the only good thing about this place is the interior decor . the staff is very rushed and i felt like i was being quickly pushed from waiting room to treatment area and then back to waiting room ( to wait for my polish to dry ) .
a breakfast buffet that would be free if you were not in vegas . coffee and other beverages are not included in the price , so a $ 12.99 buffet becomes $ 14.99 . the french toast was good , but not that good .
i decided to give a ulta one last shot . it 's just so conveniently close to my house . waited around the bare minerals counter forever for help with foundation matching before finally going and looking for someone . but then i could n't find anyone .
my ford edge has an issue with the fuel gauge . i took it to another dealership and they diagnosed an issue with the fuel pump . i moved to the madison area before being able to have the repair done .
the apartments are very nice but the staffing there is horrible . especially one in particular by the name of joanne . she was very rude , stuck up and unprofessional . somebody needs to tell her that she sucks at her job .
been here many times for car wash , but this was my last time . i said i wanted a basic wash and as usual the guy tried to sell me more . after going through just basic wash '' 3 times he gave up .
they have the worst customer service i have ever seen . its not just this location . its company wide ! all the locations . its really sad . you send thousands of dollars on an rv and then they treat you like they do .
called this agency regarding a property they had available for rent . set up an appointment to meet with their rep at the property to take a tour . they never showed . after i got home i called to find out why .
expensive . uneven nails . had to have a second person fix the first person 's filing . not worth the price .
i stayed here once before , no trouble , beautiful rooms . i booked with easy click travel . no where on my invoice was i alerted to the surprise resort fee of $ 15 per night .
stayed at this hotel from a thursday to a monday and was less than impressed . staff was very unfriendly and did n't seem to want to help out with any questions i had .
first time here and i had to wait over 25 mins for my order . when i got up to find out what was taking so long , the worker said they did n't have my order receipt .
i 'd give them a 0 star but i can not . horrible cashier bad attitude and they could care less about going the extra mile . wanted to order breakfast at 10:15 . sorry breakfast is over '' .
worst vapor place i have been to no customer service and the juice is nasty . i got gummy bear it taste like soap .
horrible ! soup tasted like bath water . and the rest tasted old and stale . veg rolls wee wrapped in some king of doughy wrapper and no filling ! drive all the way there only to be told they do n't take mastercard !
as a follow up , i left your ridiculously long line and went to another car company . 5 minutes , done ! since i had prepaid , i will attempt to obtain a refund . if not , expect reviews on social media everywhere . stay tuned .
i just spoke to daphne in the front office . i asked if there were problems with roaches , and she she has only been there for a month and has not heard of any problems with roaches .
worst ayce sushi , i have ever been to . the ayce is very limited . only saw the waiter twice . once to get our order and the other time to drop of food .
do n't use this place to sell ! they took in some items but did n't record them . said they would but that has yet to happen and it 's been almost 6 months . unfortunately , that 's not the worst of it .
cold water shower , no iron , no coffee , didnt clean my room , car noise from road . the list goes on . worst hotel experience i 've had !
not quite sure what happened here . everyone was nice and they let me see under my car when it was on the lift . they agreed to order my tires and do an alignment and would call me around noon today when the truck arrived .
run ! do not purchase a puppy here ! i fell victim to the cute puppy behind the glass and what did i end up with ? a $ 3000 dog and vet bills that are adding up since the date of purchase !
beware ! they are infested with cockroaches . do not order the parfaits . i have personally seen cockroaches crawl out of the improperly contained box of granola .
worst . pharmacy . ever .
my family has eaten at china star for years . yesterday we were there to eat and i was in the restroom the employee who put the food out did not wash his hands and went back to the kitchen .
honestly i really do n't like this location . i 've never had a positive experience here . i eat at other locations at least a couple of times in the week and i wo n't go to this one anymore .
very scary ! the owner sharon ( if she is the owner ) is a complete nut . guaranteed she will start out with can i find you an angel ? ''
recently surrounded itself with bubble tea advertising . teas are made at front of store with powder and syrup . even the teas are not real teas . just stick with noodle soup and leave the fake teas alone . tasted horrible
i would give this hotel a 0 if i could . i 've stayed there numerous times and they 've messed up my group reservation every time . the last time i stayed , i had a roach in my room .
cancel cancel and cancel . these front desk bitches will practically wait the last minute to call and let you know that your appointment has been canceled .
do n't waste your time with these guys . i called and asked for a palm tree trim . over 10 days passed and scheduler '' called me to setup a day for them to come .
our bar tender here was pretty rough around the edges cussing every sentence . this could just be the kind of atmosphere they are trying to portray . he also claimed he does n't know math and gave us more beers than we asked for which we paid for .
i 'm shocked by the positive reviews . ordered take out and the man answering the phone acted like he had never taken an order in his life .
i called three days ago and placed an order for a dress to be picked up in the las vegas store on 5 17 . today i found out that as of yesterday this store is permanently closed .
i 'm usually very happy with the food from this place but tonight that was n't the case ! my daughter found a hair in her food . i called to get a replacement meal ( exchange the bad one ) and the guy gave me an attitude !
this place is an absolute ripoff dont go with them ! you will lose thousands of dollars on things that you could have done yourself in 2 seconds . they charged us $ 500 to pick seats in business class .
the management at this complex is pathetic . it took 10 months for the maintenance to fix our move in list of items . really . 10 months . good luck .
the service was sub par . the restaurant was empty and it took them 10 minutes to ring me up for my bagels . when picking my bagels they only had three options of bagels . what bagel shop is out of 75 of their bagels . poorly operated
the new way to order sucks and is stupid . you have 6 people behind the counter just standing around talking waiting for orders . if the set up was like it was everyone would be busy . not pleased and not coming back !
he misdiagnosed me and gave me the wrong medication for something that i do n't have .
morgan our server seemed miserable to be serving tables . she oh so happily took our order . then showed up later to hand us a bill . never check on our table after someone else brought us food or checked to see if we needed anything .
terrible ! i order food for delivery , my children are vegetarians so i ordered the mac and cheese and fried green tomatoes , also the okra , and green beans with potatoes .
not gon na lie . .i had high hopes for this place . my hopes were shattered when the following happened : 1 . charged a $ 5 cover plus had to pay a $ 1 membership fee . rolling eyes what is up with these dollar membership fees ?
i called them for a simple repair to my pool pump on a tuesday . they indicated that they might be able to get to it late in the week . they took all my credit card information and said they would call . they never did .
the worst saks ever . 1 . not enough selection . i believe the buyer sucks there . 2. one of the employee said shit '' as walking out of the restroom .
terrible shop , wo n't even take responsibility for their own mistakes . just gives bs excuses
i recently went into the shop , which i always go here with my 2 year old and always buy something . this time when i made the purchase i was given my change and i was given counterfeit money as change .
after reading the reviews i am very thankful they rejected us .
not very clean , customer service was sub par . my friend ordered a chicken wrap and had to wait forever for it . they had a huge line up and not enough people to service all those people .
friendly staff , was greeted while i was looking through the menu for my to go order . the owner was very friendly and was the one helping me out . i ordered the white pizza with sausage and mushroom along with their spaghetti and garlic bread lunch special .
i will not be returning . we decided to walk in and waited 5 minutes and the only person working here barely acknowledged our presence . she told us priority was drive thru . so she kept taking their orders and making their items . meanwhile ignoring us .
it 's not the best place in town . stay a way if you can . they over price and i end up with 3 broken nails . the service is bad
food is horrible , service was very good . you get what you pay for . old dried out food . choices are pitiful . seafood and fish right next to regular food could cause someone to go into allergic shock .
sucks . dont know what i hate worse about this particular walmart , the employees , the fact that there is never enough check out open , or the face they have less to choose from than any of the other walmarts i visit . parking is awful too !
so . slow . every . time ! i do n't know if it 's just my luck , or if the slowest cashier on earth really does work 24 7 at the register .
things started off well with the staff and what not but took a turn for the worst when i was actually back in the office .
if your looking for a place or looking to use this company as your property management do not . be smart and look elsewhere . i have had the misfortune of using them . they lied about issues with apartment . theyre customer service is not even decent .
so , i used groupon and paid 15 dollars for a oil change and brake check , which was awesome . it also gives you 20 off if you need your brakes done .
beware ! $ 500 deposit to rent a car that you may not get back . shady , do n't waste your cab fare to get ripped off .
tonight i found a foreign object in my food . a plastic marker for indicating doneness of meat somehow became wrapped in my chicken quesadilla . the management was apologetic and did not charge me for it , but this was burnt wood 's last strike .
please avoid by all means this place . i had worse customer service i 've experience . the salesmen who i was working with knew very little about his own product . i had to correct him several times .
the guy is rude as fuck and persistent on being a dick to customers . things to know . rice does n't come with the meal ( we ordered chicken tiki masala ) . it 's $ 4 extra because it 's superior indian rice .
a button was missing and the fabric was ripped around the area after cleaning . owner refused to claim responsibility and fix it without charge . terrible customer service .
if i could give this place zero stars i would . this doctor is a crook and belongs behind bars ! i went here for years and i would n't go back if he was the last doctor on earth .
bring headphones . this was by far the loudest library i have ever been to and the only thing said was . '' oh yeah it is usually louder the last hour we are open . ''
learned a lesson on my recent visit . ask and confirm the price before having the service done . or you 'll end up with all sorts of $ 5 extras here and there that they tacked onto your bill .
this place has terrible customer service ! my wife booked an appt in may then got cancelled . the owner then booked another appt then they cancelled again on us .
i had the worst experience today . all i wanted to do for christmas was print out pictures for my family and it seems like the employers working the photo booth are not in the jolly spirit .
this grooming shop is closed . i believe troy moved out of state .
i went in to just get my roots touched up while i am here on vacation . came in with blonde hair and darker roots showing through and ended up leaving with my roots darker brown than when i arrived . cried when i left .
my family has totally boycotted giant eagle , mainly this location . first , the prices for groceries are rediculously high . second , the pharmacy would never have the medicine i needed in stock .
do not buy from here they sold us a lemon and wont work with us . my brother had two major repairs in two weeks that werent covered '' and they are refusing to acknowledge the car is a lemon .
first time here and we were treated quite poorly . told there was 50 minute wait but it ended up being 90 ; the extra time was because they called a number of similar size parties that had arrived after us before seating us .
i had purchases a relax & renew new client introductory package from this company to see if i like there massages . i had called many times to schedule an apt and was told they did not have any openings for weeks at a time .
cant wont follow most simple instructions . manager should read poor reviews here to find out what is wrong and fix it . however no responses . it seems they do n't care .
honestly had the worst waxing experience ever here . the only reason i came here instead of velvet ( which i love and highly recommend ) was that i needed an appointment on a sunday and european waxing had an opening .
worst service ever ! very rude bar tender . burgers are not worth the price . only decent food was sweet potato fries
the service was not spectacular . started ordering with one guy , he walked away and another jumped in . then we ordered the chicken parm and was sadly disappointed to find out that it was pretty much a frozen processed chicken breast .
could n't sleep , so i went here around 4 am . i walked in and found several homeless people sleeping on the floor . they were dirty and scary looking .
i went and asked nicely if i could get a fob cover case because when i first got my delivery of the vehicle it only came with one fob cover case and we all know the car has 2 fobs .
we were craving for original chicken sandwich . so we ordered 2 . my husband 's sandwich was good . i took a couple of bites on mine and it tasted weird . when i opened it . here 's what it looks like .
way too expensive . my wife and i spent $ 20.00 for two small yogurts . product was acceptable but the cleanliness was questionable . flies everywhere . management is aware of the problems but feels that it is the customer 's issues rather than the business 's problems .
went to ihop tonight for a late dinner at 1030 . we waited almost 10 minutes for someone to come into the lobby to seat us .
wanted to stay in for the night and wanted some delivery . i ordered the potato pancake bites an eight cut buffalo chicken pizza and an italian sub .
pizza with a side of salt . never really had a fantastic pizza from this place usually only ordered it due to it being the only places open late and located close bye . pizza and cheese are extremely salty and the side are nothing to write home about .
wish i could give them zero . went here to caribou einsteins with my hubby and son for breakfast one saturday . they served me the wrong pastry , went back to the pick-up counter where i was ignored for over 5 minutes .
this is the most deceptive company i 've dealt with in some time ! i make an appointment over the web and two days later they call to say that they wo n't be coming when i requested . now i 'm stuck and they could n't care less .
how does a restaurant not have any low calorie or no fat salad dressing ? my friend got the chicken crispers , which were inedible . a very unsatisfying lunch .
numerous times ive been here to find them out of the same ingredients . guess they dont believe in restocking .
this is the worst pediatric clinic ever ! dr. neiman needs to retire . you can tell in your visits that he is completely over it ! the nurse sherry is the worst nurse i have ever dealt with .
service was subpar from waitress stephanie . the redeeming factor was the waitress named india . she was attentive , upbeat , and friendly even though we were not in her section . i ordered bacon very very very crispy . what i got was rubbery undercooked bacon .
they suck ! go for a smog they tell me there 's 6 people ahead of me and it will be an hour and a half wait . that 's way too long when a smog is only about 3 minutes .
i had an early morning shift at work , and i thought in my head that i would need some starbucks . so i looked online for a starbucks that was open and it said that this one opened at 430 .
i wish i could give them a negative 10 ! this place sucks ! they charged me $ 800 for a starter that is usually only $ 120 . never ever go here they will rip you off
do not go here ! it 's a ripoff !
i went to terry 's today to replace a headlight in my car , an experience i did n't think would be too painful . i left $ 62 poorer , five and a half hours after i dropped my car off .
i came here one day to get my nails done for a photoshoot and the lady who did them was rude and did n't do what i asked . she over drilled and made my nails look like had already grown out .
zero stars would be too high a rating for this company . they are a complete joke . i already had 2 quotes for 500 square feet of inexpensive vinyl flooring , the highest being 2500 .
do n't go. really poor service . sat and waited for 25min to get a beer no such luck . the servers just kept walking by me like i was invisible . i could understand if they were busy but i was the only one sitting in my row .
as a loyal nissan owner & a person that frequents nissan dealers & service departments i can say they 're the worst . we were so excited for this new location to open as its so close to home .
sitting at this restaurant right now , been here 45 minutes and my drink has been empty the majority of that time . have not been able to get a refill or my food yet .
denny 's food is just whatever but the service sucks . my fork had food on it for one . there was only one server and she did n't even ask us if we needed anything . i wouldnt recommend this location
i love jimmy johns but this location is terrible ! the last two times in the drive thru they 've overcharged me !
this is by far the most horrible bww we have ever been to ! i ordered extra extra crispy wings because slimy and soft chicken skin makes me gag ! the chicken was not even crispy at all !
should get no star period . i had an appointment and checked in . the place was packed . i waited 30 minutes and went to front desk to find out what the delay is and nobody was at the front .
be careful of this place . the fettuccini alfredo is lousy at best . it tastes like a powdered cheese type sauce and definitely not fresh . the pizza is not fresh in the morning hours either . i believe that it sits out all night .
by far the worst south east asian food in all the cities i 've ever visited . even london 's malaysian dishes are miles ahead . i 'd give it negative stars if i could .
i would not recommend doing promotional work with this company . its been almost 2 months and i still hav n't recieved my money . bad business . off to small claims i go
eat there a couple of times a month . usually good food and service , not this time . bread on sandwich stale . extremely long wait for food and not prepared right . waitress not paying attention . too bad enjoyed it in the past .
i 'm sitting here at cmc mercy hospital . in the worst surgical waiting area . while a loved one is preparing for surgery . why would you have a waiting area smack dab in the front of the hospital . with all the other families .
the service was awful on a monday evening about 7pm . we went to get a couple slices of pie , to go .
there is nothing positive to say about this buffet . in the city where every hotel has one , i 'd expect that excess competition would breed quality . clearly , this is n't the case . the choices were few . hardly anything was very fresh .
do not go here . they cut my dogs ear so deep . please save yourself money and your dogs suffering . absolutely horrible service especially when answering phone calls . honestly , i do n't feel like they care about the animals at all .
i 've been taking my vehicles here since 2013 . i 've never had an issue until today . i understand that sometimes oil does get spilled around the filler . when i got home i opened up the hood and could n't believe how much oil there was .
completely flavorless and expensive for being so terrible ! it is hands down the worst vietnamese food that i have ever had , which is quite an accomplishment . the service was horrible . they bought us the wrong food and then overcharged us .
after giving this place two times , i will not be returning . the margaritas are like juice and not at all worth the price . bartender was rude and clearly not liking his job .
this review is regarding the online ordering process using their website . i ordered food via the online system and my credit card number was stolen and used to charge thousands of dollars in expensive merchandise .
i went here because they absorbed the practice i 'd been going to , which closed when the main doctor retired . this is the most impersonal office i 've ever been in . talk about feeling like cattle !
ghetto ! i new better to try this particular long john 's but i was in the area so i thought i would suck it up . it took forever to get my order in . the employees were slow and looked like they were working a prison detail .
went there a few times years ago and it was decent . went recently and it was awful . food , service sucked and the prices were high . get it together or close it .
went there yesterday to get a rook peircing . i honestly think this man was high on something , he almost tripped over nothing while preparing my ear for the peircing . very unprofessional .
very poor customer service . have a special listed saying 10 items for 39.95 but if you have 11 items they charge you full price and you are not eligible for the cheaper rate .
this restaurant can not get the orders right two days in a row they can not even put the order in right or bring it out to the customers with all your food right missing food on your plate had to send it back two days in a row
the small dog side was n't even open . tried to bring my pug to play and he 's been already plenty of other dogs before .
went here on a friday night in group of 8 . surprisingly , place wasnt even busy . servers were busy though socializing '' with other customers and the one supposedly responsible for taking our orders wasnt around for good 15mins .
was just in there . .tried to charge me 13 dollars for a hot dog and chili cheese fries . walked out . use the go all the time . .the manager was really rude . .i will be calling the owner . .never going back .
went in to look around the shop and while browsing found a tie that i really liked . when i tried to ask if the tie was available in black the sales lady said you need to make an appointment to ask me about anything '' .
let me start off by saying that i only made a yelp account just so i could leave this review haha . went there today with my girlfriend and do n't plan on going back . i got the tri athlete omelette .
i needed to have my gels removed . they soaked my hands in acetone forever . i ended up peeling the polish off myself because the man who i was waiting for to do my nails was busy playing video games . his hands looked like a mechanics .
one of the worst places i 've been in phoenix .
this place used to be great- great bagels and good service . since the change in ownership they have gone downhill . poor customer service , not as clean and food quality has declined . ownership is rude and makes excuses rather than change anything .
imagine the worst experience ever , these guys are that x10 . doing drugs on the job , check . breaking my stuff , check . doing an awful job , check . had to ask them to leave .
this place is horrible ! small portions and the service is terrible . the food definitely lacked some flavor , i would not suggest this to anyone .
tip for oreganos staff : do n't make your customer wait an hour and a half for their order and then get it wrong ! thanks for ruining our evening
poorly set up for the super bowl . forgot our food , lost our drinks and then closed the bathrooms while we waited 45 minutes to get our check . never again !
i was shocked to see a store selling a racist item . i 've posted it public from my facebook . its 2016 . if your not part of the solution your part of the problem . shame on you .
disappointing and overpriced . szechuan chicken was bland . potstickers greasy and under seasoned . noodles dry . wo n't eat there again .
this was the worst hotel experience i have ever had . i stayed at this hotel during the taste of charlotte and the location was perfect for the event . too bad that was the only benefit .
i am not only a past customer , but came in to donate several boxes of books and movies to them .
yuck . had to send a piece of sushi back because of a bug and should 've known then to stop eating . tummy did n't feel so good the rest of the night .
called them and never received a call back . went with another tree service that did a great job trimming my mesquite tree . they had good reviews so i thought i 'd try them out .
poor service . waited 40 minutes at lunch for food . peeps coming in after us served before us . not friendly . going back to blue 32 . worth the drive for better food and service
we loved this store . for about a month . then they sold us fish knowing they had ick . we knew it was the new fish because they had spots first . after trying two different medicines all but one of our fish died .
this has to be the worst mcdonalds ever . i cant believe i am doing a review on a fast food chains but i tried to give it a chance . the staff is extremely rude and slow . i wait 18 min for my food .
i 'm not being nice on this review ! i felt cheated ! the tiny burgers and disgusting crinkle fries , and ridiculous a la cart prices gives this place one lousy star . i ordered a $ 4 grilled cheese for my son and looked at it .
i am changing my last review . we came in tonight was told that the system is down and they are not sitting anyone until it is up . but a party of 6 just came in after we were waiting for 30 mins .
really terrible experience in every way : bruschetta was horrible and do it yourself '' - which i have never seen done that way . looked like the kitchen was being lazy . hot tea ordered was only slightly warn .
would not eat here again . food was cold and too sweet . there are better buffets in pittsburgh area . if you like to eat low quality , mass produced food then this is your place to eat .
stay away i understand there prices may be appealing but stay away . i 've gotten a sew in weave there and it last about 3weeks before the tracks become very loose and the thread hangs and what not .
last time i had a membership here , i literally had to quit just because of the stink in the men 's locker room . there was such a foul smell coming from the plumbing , that i could not stand .
freaking terrible ! they sent me the wrong pizza then when i called to get it fixed they told me i was wrong ! that came from the owner ! i will make sure everyone knows how they really feel about their customers !
i have owned rental properties for over 25 years and this is the worst property management company experience i have ever had . terrible !
these guys are a bunch of flakes . i was going to buy a used truck and thought we made a deal . i gave them my credit information and money to put down and told them ill be there next weekend to pick it up.
i walked in to get a spray tan last week and left within 5 minutes because of how rude the front desk people were . the front desk woman i went to was extremely nasty to me and treated me and my friend like we were beneath her .
got a car and returned to the airport location . forgot my phone , galaxy note 5. by the time i got back to the rental car area it had been an hour . to my surprise my phone had not been found ?
where do i start . the good ; it was spacious , no waiting for tables , drinks were delivered quickly , the waitress was attentive and personable . the bad ; the food and mostly everything else ! there was no one there eating on a saturday night .
this subway is absolutely terrible . the employees give the impression that they could care less about your business . in fact , it almost seems if they 'd rather not be bothered by you coming in . we only go to subway to get our kids meatball sandwiches .
i ordered two med sized pizza five minutes before closing was told it would be delivered , but it would be about an hour and a half .
when hokkaido first opened my husband and i were excited to have a new sushi place just around the corner from us . when we first ate there , the sushi was always fresh .
thanks to this location , i was charged $ 140 at the dealership all because a key battery was placed in wrong . i went to this location after my car was not reading my smart key .
this place is so unbelievably overrated . long line , packed dance floor and it 's impossible to get a drink . i would never come back .
the past 2 months this place has really gone to garbage . staff and management are the worst . pizza has either been burnt or way too much sauce .
went here last night looking for some good asian food . mistake . obviously the cook does n't know what he she is doing . the mango beef was horrible . the beef was soggy , the sauce was a mix between sweet and gross .
this place is horrible . roaches , termites and mice all over the place . bob and bobbi are poor managers and even worse people .
the customer service at chipotle is usually great but that 's not the case with this location . the employees are rude and act as if you do n't exist . i stand there waiting while they goof off . i will not be back
my grandma has season passes here . every now and then , there is a decent play here . most of the time , we leave at intermission . unless , like today , there was no intermission . buyer and cellar . ''
went here for breakfast today . my daughter is allergic to soy and she asked if they would cook her omelette without using an oil containing soy . they refused and the waitress said absolutely not . waitress had an attitude and would not even discuss the situation .
as a previous reviewer wrote , this company has a terrible bait & switch scheme going on . you almost never get the $ 1.99 price . i would n't recommend them at all .
my wife and i found a living room and dining set for our new house that we love . the salesman was extremely helpful and offered us all of these great deals . it is now two months later and we still do n't have the complete purchase .
worst ever , lunch menu includes soup , which was the most liquid cream of tomato soup , tasted ok .
i once looked forward to visiting this great mexican restaurant . it has truly hit bottom . the food is careless , the portions have shrank , the quality is gone and it is obvious that no one is paying attention to food .
11pm is closing time . my wife and i walked in last night at 1030pm to find everyone more focused on closing up for the night than greeting a customer . cooks were standing on counters cleaning the air filters above the stove it looked like .
had the tacos last night at this place , had heard they were awesome . ugh ! gross ! order a fish taco , the corn tortilla was right out of the package never touch a griddle or stove .
this place is the worst ! the wife and i came in to buy paint and were treated miserably . the older dude with the frosted hair and goatee - black glasses - is a clown and took an eternity to take our order .
i had been there a few times. they started getting used to padding what needed to be done . i could tell they were adding a few items to get the bill up. today . they went over the top . just shy of $ 600 for spark plugs .
i ca n't believe that no one has complained about the annoying airplanes that take off all night long ! the hotel was very nice and the rooms are very comfortable for the price as long as you can get past the not being able to sleep part .
my fiancé has purchased sandwiches from this location a couple of times and he loves it . my review is based on the lack of willingness to make any substitutions . i walked in and informed the guy i am pregnant so i can not eat deli meats .
awful awful awful ! waitress was friendly and prompt , but after our order was put in it took over 30 min for the food to reach the table . i ordered pineapple upside down pancakes .
the reason why you have n't seen me in months is because i like to surround myself with good , positive energy and i 'm simply not feeling it at your store . i have no problem saying good things about shops when i have a good experience .
okay . i hate to be the one negative review on here . but here 's the deal , my boyfriend tried to get me flowers for valentines day , which was lovely .
do n't go here . plenty of other ihops to go to or even other restaurants . management and service is very poor . ignorant servers . advice to management : replace your crew and yourselves .
well so disappointed this use to be our favorite . but our last to visits where just so so at best the food was just poor quality .
just received their market activity '' newsletter only to find not only a suspicious amount of units being up for sale in my complex but my very own along with my neighbor 's being listed as for sale .
if you have more tan four you are out pluck siting together if someone has the only table . you can have whole wheat pasta on anything as long as it is penne .
where is this owner or manager ? please show some pride ! i have to say that growing up in de with the original capriottis & a small business owner myself i am beyond disappointed . this location is a crap hole and that 's being nice !
i wish i could give it 0.00 . it was not great , overpriced ( 26.00 for a very small entree and cup of streamed rice . do n't go there .
the very first time i got the watermelon drink it was amazing !
on line waiting for paperwork and car , line is 45 people deep with one employee check in people . omg ! it will be at least an hour wait . get some employees ! sorry but the rate was not worth this kind of wait !
the food has gone way down hill !
this place was atrocious through uber eats . i placed an order and it was confirmed but never made its way to me . so i phoned in and the gentleman told me the order somehow got cancelled on their end .
second time i 've eaten at this subway . the girl behind the counter could n't even be bothered to greet me and was very skimpy on ingredients . staff totally rude ! will never eat at this subway again .
the worst panera experience ever ! first my girlfriend gets a pumpkin latte and takes a zip and it is so ungodly hot that it burned her mouth . granted we are people who normally drink hot coffee , but this was lava !
they are late calling in prescription . they are very late in calling on lab work , and they have misdiagnosed results . never will i go again .
bad customer service and rude employees . unfriendly atmosphere . the young girl serving me looked disgusted to work there and was purely throwing the food on the plate ! not going back
this place is so disappointing . the food is underwhelming and actually pretty terrible . we have been there 3 different times hoping to like it but finally came to the conclusion that it 's just not gon na happen .
sketchy sketchy sketchy place . if you 've never been here let me describe it in a few words . it 's basically a garage in the back of a building with no windows , trash everywhere and mean looking people .
it was just gross . i had chicken and broccoli with fried rice and my boyfriend had general tso . i tried both and neither had any flavor . the general tso sauce did not taste good .
absolutely the worst service ever . after helping me with my aquarium he took about 500 dollars of my equipment with him and will not return it after months of me trying to get it back . do not use this company .
i purchased a pair of glasses for an upcoming road trip . in store service went well .
tried to go tonight for a late dinner after 10pm . their hours are deceiving because they 're open late only to serve alcohol . i get that alcohol is where they make the money , but then they should advertise correctly .
i 've been to some lousy chain restaurants but this place is in a league of its own when it comes to service . i ordered a turkey sandwich and asked to have mustard put on it .
i lived in the northwest for a while and am use to my big foot coffee or my woods coffee . this is garbage coffee i mean dd or mcd does better .
do n't waste your time . nothing but headaches and watch out for the agency cj barnes , she 's unprofessional and likes to hide around the bush , does n't even explain anything ! worse mistake wasting $ 200 for applications !
the service was mediocre at best , and unfriendly . the pizza is far from famous . i ordered a slice of pepperoni to go and my order was placed on a paper plates and the placed in a paper bag with no other covering .
i decided to write an update and lower heidi 's score due to some of the feedback i have been getting from my guests who did n't want to tell me what they really felt about the food . they were trying to spare my feelings .
this business very dishonest ! one of their leased or rental car hit my car . they did n't not pay for the damages they refused and gave me the run around .
this is the worst sushi in the area . terrible service and the sushi rolls are small and poor quality . lunch specials are cheap for a reason . the rice is hard and stale and the rolls are tiny without much filling . under poor management ownership .
this is the worst idea ever . the bus tool forever because it kept stalling and we had to stop on the strip and everywhere else . i never did this shuttle before and i never will . not worth the ten dollars you save one way .
the response from the management team feels like a canned response and not sincere . no way we 're going back .
my husband said this was the worst burger he ever had . veggie burger tasted plastic , but the onion rings were good . so disappointing b c the marketing is good and its the same ppl who own new york fries , but it 's really yucky .
after waited over 2 hrs to see the doc , he tried to take x-ray even i have taken one and mri 2weeks ago . ma was helpful to debate w the doc to not take x-ray . you should be prepare to wait when you go .
i am completely in shock at the behavior of the employees at this store . an employee by the name of derek used foul racist language towards a young lady simply asking about a price mistake since the menu read one thing and the register another .
place is nice to take pics and the bulb idea is near but man do their drinks suck . tapioca with a side order of water .
we called our order ahead and arrived 10 min , we then had to wait another 45 min for our order . the entire wait the man making the sushi was yelling and berating his fellow co workers . it was embarrassing .
you can pretty much rest assured that the prescription you dropped off or that your physician called in will not be ready when you arrive for pick up -- and they might not even know anything about it .
nothing fabulous about this business , the soul food is mediocre . people that are not use to soul food will think this place is amazing . overly priced , no family meals . i choose church 's chicken any day over this place . i mean nothing special .
beware - i got extremely sick from one of the meals i ate from this my fit foods . i ate a chili meal and later that night i woke up in the middle of the night so dizzy i could n't even stand up let alone walk .
ordered online with yelp 24 app . food was cold , looks like it was reheated definitely not freshly made . very disappointed , we just wanted to have some late night food delivered but apparently this ca n't be done in vegas .
awful , just awful . please avoid this drycleaner at all costs .
overall not worth coming to save a few bucks , food is bad .
i really really was hoping to give this place a great rating , but i am unable to . whoever says these burgers taste like white castle , has obviously never had a real white castle burger ' . even though they were cooked fresh , they tasted old .
i was leaving from the pittsburgh airport early in the morning so i decided to stay here for 8 hours before my fight . i quickly determined this to be a very bad choice .
i dropped off a purse in the beginning of march to have the handles repainted . i was told that it would take 3-4 weeks .
i 've lived in the neighborhood for 10 years and we need more great restaurants . unfortunately , open kitchen is not one of them .
this is the worst place to stay in . the hallways smell of it do n't know what . the rooms are awful . the king size bed had pillows that were smaller than a standard pillow .
i usually frequent to salem location , but stopped at this one as it was convenient at the time . i really wish i had n't . the gym is absolutely disgusting .
horrible service , every time i go they forget something . i 'm just over this particular spot . thanks for your service i hope others do n't get screwed like me on a 25 dollar order
do not use this company . scam artists . our warranty company contacted them to come out and look at two issues . before even taking a real look at our toilet and facet , they insisted that both pieces needed replacement .
this store gives smith 's and the kroger brand a bad name . i almost want to stop shopping smith 's altogether because of the experiences i have had at this specific location .
looking for a late night meal . actually , just wanted wings . called to place an order for takeout at 12:45 . manager ( female ) says they closed the kitchen 10 minutes ago and last call for bar just happened .
the worst landlord in phoenix ! you are better off sleeping under the freeway then to rent from this sorry excuse for landlord !
i ordered pizza for my company meeting . when the meeting recessed 90 minutes later the pizza had yet to arrive . i had a missed call informing me that we were outside their delivery range ( then why did the order go through ? )
the was the worst maintained course i 've played on , maybe ever . i could see more brown dirt than green grass on much of the fairways and even the greens . i wo n't go back and i will tell people to avoid .
i would rather not give it a star at all but in order to write a review you have to . i have never had this type of treatment on my life .
horrible service . ordered pizza from them first there was a rude woman who took my order second the delivery guy was rude was refusing to give me the pizza so i could inspect it because past orders were burnt . never going to order from them again !
easily the worst thai food i have ever had . service was awful - waited 10 minutes before being addressed . tom yum came out smelling like my dog 's breathe - which was promptly sent back uneaten and for which they still had the audacity to charge us .
after the 3rd time , they had to reschedule my kids appointment , i returned the phone call and the lady put me on hold after 5 minutes , i hung up .
this company bought the paper after a refinance . i did n't care did not check on them i have worked with may company 's in the last 40 years .
what a joke . i ordered a groupon for two night with upgraded room option included . two days after check out my credit card was charged a $ 89 dollar upgrade fee . i called to inquire about the fee and they said they would reverse the charge .
very bad customer service . avoid like the plague . ordered some oakley frames . they charged me $ 190 then said it would take 1-2 weeks to get in . sooo 2 weeks go by and i call .
i went here about two weeks ago for an oil change . while everything went fairly smoothly , i had a weird feeling that they did n't know what the heck they were doing . well , i was right .
just do n't go here . this was the worst carne asada burrito i 've had ever ! the place is a shite hole , their rolled tacos are over priced and not so good . they even messed up a veggie burrito .
only one star because i do n't think 0 stars is an option . they are more than happy to make an appointment but do n't tell you that they need you to bring your insurance benefits information because they are too incompetent to do their job .
fatburger is good but this location is not . had an encounter with a rude lady there . i went in to order a plain cheeseburger to go . i said cheese only -- nothing else on the burger please . not hard right ?
cant stand this place ! its always a mess and the cashiers are so pushy , then try and rush you out !
do n't order here unless you have two hours to wait for delivery . this restaurant is affiliated with grubhub and they do n't even bother notify them of delays . after several calls with grubhub i called human express and was told we very busy ! ''
came in friday night . went for drinks and stayed for the dancing . our server was busy but he was able to take pretty good care of us . ( he also became the bartender later that night ) . the caesar 's were so good .
racist owner . actually told me he was n't worried about a customer because they were black so they ca n't afford anything they were looking at anyway . no customer service skills and ridiculously overpriced .
i walked into the store , not one person greeted me . the employees looked right at me and walked off or helped other customers . i was interested in making a purchases but definitely needed help but nobody bothered to help .
never again , poor quality . sushi and maki rolls are overpacked with rice .
this is a very dirty hotel . first room we got had blood and hair on the sheets . it took two hours for a manger to inform us that it 's not blood '' and he 's sure it 's a cleaning product .
i got inside info in this place . first the owner is a crazy indian guy from mumbai who does n't care about anything .
the wait time for help is terrible and the communication from the staff is little to none .
do not waste your time or energy going to this place . the office requires a 30 min prior appointment check in time then you wait 2 hours to be seen . unprofessional staff .
the food is ok but the service and person and i mean person is not the brightest . ended up waiting 25 mins for my food
i decided to take my father in law to this establishment . my father is a 6 foot 5 guy and you cant really miss him . the restaurant was packed and we were waiting for a table .
do n't sign up for any of their special events unless you want to be spammed with every single one from then on out .
been here a number of times with my granddaughter . worst mcdonalds i 've ever been to . the staff is consistently rude . not a happy place . i 'm thinking bad management .
simply the worst medical office in town , waiting time is unacceptable and we have been dealing with billing issues for over a year when all they had to do was send the proper referral to the insurance company .
the little girl at the cashier , is a bitter bitch . she did n't smile . she did n't put down to go . she should n't be working if she unhappy .
my husband and i compared prices with lowes and home depot , and then bought all our new stainless steel kitchen appliances here . ( oven , fridge , dishwasher . ) we were very pleased . until plaza 's appliance installer destroyed our kitchen countertops !
here 's the difference between circle k and quiktrip . when quiktrip is busy all of the employees will drop everything and run registers until the customers have been served and the line is gone .
i wish i could give this place zero stars . i waited half an hour for a pedicure without any updates on how long it would take . there were two people in line behind me .
first and only stop here . prep line was slow . carne asada was dry . charged over $ 6 for a chesse quesadilla . no coke or dr. pepper products in the fancy drink machine . all indoor tables dirty , trash cans full to over flowing .
in town on business , i phoned in an order togo . salad we in a tiny container that was about a quarter full , maybe 4 pieces of lettuce , 2 cherry tomatoes and 7 croutons . the ranch dressing was really good though !
this is the worst car rental save your self some time and trouble and look for a different rental car company the service is absolutely horrible
great atmosphere , mediocre service ( slow to get started ) and mediocre food . but i really wanted to like this place ! i kept trying to find a redeeming quality in the rare salmon ( ordered medium ) .
really was not a fan of this place . i bought a green soup and it had no flavour , tasted like it was made with water instead of veggie broth maybe ?
just walked in and the lady said she was closed yet yelp states that they 're open . she refused to to a toddler boys haircut . first time walking into that place and i will never go in there again .
horrible ! how this business is the official pizza of the arizona diamondbacks '' is beyond me . ordered twice , take out & delivery , the same thing : new york combo .
beware . .do not eat here ! rude owner ! there is a very rude man working at this location . which come to find out he 's also the owner . today i received very poor service from him and will not be returning again .
went here on an early sunday afternoon . the place was empty , but we were a large party of 16 , and got seated right away .
i truly wish i could give negative stars ! was double charged for my procedure !
friday night and we ca n't get any tv 's changed . apparently something wrong with wifi or manager has no clue how to change . big bar , lots of people and no control over tv 's . never heard that in a bar '' or restaurant '' .
terrible service . i 'd give it zero stars of i could . had n't eaten all day after a busy day at work and thought i 'd get a pizza and fries delivered .
i can not believe it . bought a pendant only to find out it is a knockoff of an original artist . i will be trying to get refund . do n't trust this vendor .
sure you are sorry . he did not fix anything at all . nada ! all he did was talked to you on the phone , charge the credit card and leave .
just finished my lunch ed 's . normally i do n't like to write a bad review but i think this is one that needs to be out there . the place was clean the staff friend and the service good .
the manager was beyond rude and extraordinarily dismissive . i brought in over 10 pairs of talbots heritage slacks that had been dry cleaned and were in perfect condition .
first of all , i should have never written a review , or been asked to write one before i could get out of my first office visit so do n't write one until you have results .
my coworker went here ( the one in asu memorial union ) for breakfast sometimes , so i decided to try it out too . i purchased a coffee and a brownie , the lady told me that she needed to check in the kitchen .
i agree with all the many other negative reviews , i was astounded at their high prices , unless they are family meals for four , their pricing is absurd .
while i love carl 's jr. this was the first and last time this location will be getting our business .
could not dislike this place anymore than i do now . have tried to come here twice to eat .
i wanted a change from going to sheila 's eyebrow threading so i decided to go here . i came out with very thin and uneven eyebrows . -.- i told her i wanted a clean up and a little bit of shape to my eyebrows .
i have been going here ever since i got my french bulldog nearly 4 years ago . my dog was sick and needed care and i was told on a tuesday that i could n't get in to see the doctor until friday .
i do not recommend this place when i first walked in i was greeted with a hi what you want '' ! which is very rare in a nail place .
there wings are terrible . do n't order pickup because they neglect to pack your food carefully . i 'm not at all impressed . in fact , i 'm disappointed .
no free ice tea . the waitress was completely clueless about the offer. wasted my data and battery for checking in.
this is not a bad review for b dubs in general , just this location . firstly , there 's hardly enough sauce on the wings , especially compared to other b dubs around madison . secondly , i got takeout once and ordered 20 boneless wings .
food is consistently cold and cooked long before . definitely one of the worst wendys out there .
i paid for the top wash , when my car was finished it still had half of a dozen dirty spots on it from bird shit . did not have a shine to it at all and from i 've seen they do n't even offer a tire shine .
run away from this company ! charged me $ 400 to replace my ac capacitor . what a rip off ! the part only cost $ 50 at the most .
very short and rude on phone . i waited over a week to get an inspection . they were referred by my realtor who is also a friend , did n't expect this .
my wife went in to get new iphone screen protectors and received no help . we asked for a recommendation and was told it 's whatever you prefer . '' we did n't end up buying anything because the individual did n't help us .
how funny ! it says urgent care , but it 's really not an urgent care . i 'm seriously beginning to dislike vegas even more than i did already . this whole city is filled with idiots that do n't how to properly post or advertise .
terrible . so slow and inefficient . i really wish my mail was n't being held hostage here .
this place was closed at 8:45 when yelp said they were open till 10pm - really not impressed . i called to find out exactly where they were and they did n't bother to tell me that they were closing .
i got sick last time i ordered from them , i am not sure if the food was n't fresh or if it 's because it took so long to get the food .
disgusting flea bag of a hotel . staff is incredibly rude and disrespectful . best western should be ashamed to even be associated with this place . avoid !
this place has gone way downhill since our last visit in 2016 . service was terrible . when we walked in the waitress pointed at a table and then ignored us for 10 minutes even though the place was empty . there is virtually no communication from wait staff .
i had to change my review and wishes i could give no star 's at all .
never never again . do n't go there even for free mani pedi master bebe fucked up all my nails guys , i was with my husband .
i would give this place a negative review if possible . clearly they always run an hr behind but fail to tell anyone that when they arrive . i arrive a half hour for my first appointment with paperwork filled out .
my wife went in for coffee while i ordered subs next door . she returned right as our subs were ready . no coffee in hand . there was no one at the front counter to take order .
i called to see what i needed to bring to qualify for a loan . i had everything but a utility bill under my name because i stay with my parents .
mediocre food for the price , the bread area and dessert area had bugs flying around the food and on the food . and to top it off there was a bird flying around and the wait staff did not care .
good luck getting seated , and then better luck if they actually serve you . we waited 15mins , asked for a menu 2x , and did n't get one .
shady . shady . shady . went to get my smog inspection first thing asked to pop the hood while still in the parking lot . told i have to do all these repairs in order to pass inspection . right .
second time visiting , this time for lunch . omg what a difference and not in a positive way . i asked for a sandwich and a pint which i enjoyed .
just the facts : the worst hibachi style meal in pittsburgh . try benihana for the food or nakama for the atmosphere . i live by the waterfront and frequent all of the restaurants located there .
pros : restaurant was very clean and our server was top notch . cons : in our party of 4 three of us ordered the country fried chicken . it seemed like it was from a school lunch room .
my grandmother was here recently and they misdiagnosed her . we had a number of other issues . i would not recommend this place .
i have been coming here since it opened . we ordered take out tonight and the quality was terrible . we were all very disappointed
overpriced . have a groupon for another location though . will give them another shot
so ive ordered the delivery three times now . same thing each time . the combination egg noodle soup . supposed to come with egg noodles , shrimp , and pork . everytime ive ordered this , i 've literally received 1 shrimp . yea , one single shrimp .
you most watch new 13 , this restaurant was shut down by the health district for inadequate refrigeration and further feeding their sabotage theory . do you you know what will you been eating here today ?
talked with cathy at naked pizza . she told me that i was dumb , and that at naked pizza the customer was n't right .
wish i could go lower than 1 star for this one . we walked in and looked around , looking at frames for a bit . after 20 minutes we decided that no one was going to help us so we walked up the the back counter .
do n't stop there it 's the worst kfc as far service and food . do yourself a favor a drive to the 67th ave kfc or taco bell . at least you will feel good about not making a bad decision .
terrible ; probably the worst chinese food i have ordered in recent memory . i ordered orange beef , general tao chicken and sweet and sour ( see pic of each ) . they all were way too battered and frankly all tasted the same .
i am visiting from out of town and i needed a bouquet . this was the closest place to my hotel . the reviews were n't great but i was desperate . i went here on a monday during posted business hours ( i showed up around 10:15 ) .
help is more interested in what 's going on between their co-workers than getting a first timer 's order correct . ( was informed it was 1st time there ) and now will never be back !
i came here because i red some reviews and looks like a really nice place with good food . the result was very different . the food was good but not exceptional and the service was very cold . the waitress was totally unhelpful with the menu .
the burger was tasteless , overcooked and made from bad meat . the chicken in the chicken burger was dry and tasteless . the beer was served in a can and we had to pay for the fries that were left on our table when we returned our food .
equipment is dirty and slow , after switching machines and cancelling print jobs countless times because of slow connection my next resort was to pay for an express print service but with no time guarantee because apparently sometimes the network is n't working so they ca n't print .
i do n't understand how this place is still running ? it 's terrible and keeps getting worse and worse as the years go on .
the unenthusiastic rachel needs to be canned . i met up with my friend there one day and before i could say anything he said exactly what i was thinking . this is the worst starbucks ever !
not capable of telling the truth . they will promise too be there at 3:00 but will not . they than will claim 10 minutes for the next two hours . avoid at all cost .
this is a review of their service department . they will charge you an arm and a leg before they are willing to do any thing , they call it a diagnosis charge .
went to price tires said could n't give me a warranty on a t tires on my 4x4 .
i 've been to clearly three times in the last month - first to get an eye exam , then to get a contact lens fitting and to place an order , and then again for some follow up paper .
i have never left a review before but this place was so horrible that it 's worth a review . i ordered 3 bean & cheese burritos ( added rice in one ) for pick up and it was horrible .
do n't shop here ! bought an $ 800 tv . no help to car even though they were supposed to help load it . got it home , opened the box & tv was clearly used .
just terrible they kept on messing up my order and when i tryed to tell them they messed up my order they acted like i was wrong . if you want to go to mc donalds avoid this place
one advice : if you want to sit on the beautiful rooftop patio , make sure you take your oxygen tank with you . it 's filled with cigarette smoke and no air circulation .
i have been a patient of dr. simms for over 10 years and recently have been very disappointed with the care i receive . the office staff is always confused as to whom i am and if i should or should not have a co-pay .
( denver location ) . horrible business ethics . my wife purchased $ 50 worth of flat stone for our patio to make sure it was the correct style . 2 days later we decided to go with a different style stone from them .
must say i am not impressed in the least with the district store . first : ordered a wedding band from a collection they carried and was assured it would be to me in time for the wedding the following week .
very disappointed in my appointment '' today . after being told comments about being late , even only a few minutes , i showed up 10 minutes early only to wait another 10 after my appointment time .
wow . i 'm not sure how this guy stays in business . i have a piece of granite i need installed . so i called this company . what a joke . he starts asking me a bunch questions that a granite installer would know .
was eating in the food court beside this place after it was closed . there is a window that looks into where they prepare their food and seen a mouse climb the plug wire onto the table .
store told me one thing and cox told me another . they really do n't know much about customer service . i have had all kind of issues .
the dentist overall did a nice job , however this location quoted me one fee structure and when it came to billing charged a completely different amount . making both my insurance and myself pay more in the long run .
i wanted a cover-up of a tattoo which i had several laser removal treatments on ( not completely gone , but significantly lighter ) . i saw many positive reviews for this place so i decided to give it a try .
i 'm a real fan of teavana , might also say i 'm a tea junkie , but this fairview location is dreadful ! staff are extremely lazy , personally very rude and unwelcoming .
regular customers . like the food but went in tonight while it was busy and got horrible service- from the owner no less ! it 's on thing to be busy but to be blown off like we were was very disappointing . we probably wont go back .
1st time here , after we finished eating in the restaurant we noticed some gnats or fruit flies flying all around some of the dishes and the bbq area . that was years ago .
their ice cream is terrible now . not the creamy custard they used to have . bought a small vanilla cone $ 3.50 ! and it was icy and yellow and no flavor . guess the economy caught up with them and sells a cheap product now .
if i could rate this place less than 1 star i would ! for starters they never answer the phone even though they have about 4 people sitting in the office on their phones . if you have a maintenance issue you may as well fix it yourself .
this is my 2nd review . this is our hood and they just can not get it right here . the staff is awful .
strange concept . you order at the bar . get the order from the bar . then clean your own table ! what the hell did i leave a tip for ? the food was less than average and over-priced . i had the fish sandwich .
so i took my 4runner in for service a couple of months ago when my ac fan blower was on the fritz . i kind of knew what was wrong but i wanted to make sure .
wow what a horrible experience . here are the highlights staff poorly trained and unmotivated to work . standing around , picks stray fries up off counter and throws on food trays , socializing while many people waiting . no hustle . the food was expensive .
i do n't support places of business that treat their workers like $ hit . i have known several people who worked for safeway including this store and been treated like trash . their practices are shady at best . shame on safeway .
well i had to give a star because required . this place is a star minus . land scraping does not exist and the up keep is just a grade above a bed bug infested super 8 hotel so what does that tell you .
hello , this review was from when i went about two weeks ago . just got around to writing the review . i apologize but i did not get her name . small lady with black hair and high flip flop shoes . that is all i remember
you need to update your yelp hours . i drove here to find out they were closed ! they really close at 7pm and not 8pm . really a big inconvenience .
reps are great , never had any issues getting service started . my issue is with the manager nick . he and the rep stated if i bought a fit bit when i began my new service he would credit me $ 40 on my bill . done deal .
the staff very unfriendly , but that was n't what bothered me . after i got home from getting french acrylics i realized that the tips were n't fully glued to my nails , leaving a huge gap between the acrylic tip and the end of my nail .
rude customer service . never going back ordered 2 blizzards and an order of pretzel sticks ( which was served in a small short cup ) the pretzels were extremely hot . it should 've been placed in a bag rather than just handing it over .
too good to be true ! i got a dining pub table last month . when i got home , there was a crack on the top ! i had to drive all the way back and got it exchanged .
horrible slow service ! they were semi crowded and lots of employees but slow . i went inside because the drive thru line was long . i think the biggest problem with this location is that it is a long john silver as well .
we first went here when they first opened and the food was great , each time we have gone back it has gotten worse . the only consistently good thing is the carne asada , everything else is bland and a waste of money .
i called to order a sandwich so i could grab it before running off to a convention . they refused to take my order . you have to appear in person and stand around to get takeout . do you know what year it is ? i went there .
the staff are all very nice and very understanding . i hate to leave this clinic as it is convenient and with competent assistants however , the actual doctor is rude and condescending to us .
the fella called on a monday and arranged for them to come out on saturday at 3:00 for a home window tinting estimate . by 3:30 on saturday , he had n't shown up so we called his mobile number - it had been disconnected .
bad service , bad experience , i requested a blanket and unbelievably been totally ignored .
if i could give this place zero stars , i would . this is by far the worst mexican food i 've ever had . firstly , the horchata is made from a mix . as a result of this , it is chalky .
this used to be our favorite chinese restaurant in the area , but it seems it has been taken over by new ownership . the flavor is nowhere near what it used to be .
dont eat here . just got food poisoning from their shrimp last night
do n't believe the hype . this place has horrible customer service . i needed a tire replaced and of course i get hassled above and beyond what i needed . no , i do n't want three tires .
this place is closed . i got a refund on my groupon . perhaps the one in surprise is still in business ( ? )
i left the doctors office because of the staff , they are ignorant and rude . my husband however stayed and has been a patient for at least 8 years .
against my better judgement i tried them again because they are so close to where i work . brian was rude , unhelpful and has no customer service skills . if corporate headquarters is reading this , you need to fire brian , before you loose all your customer !
what has happened to this place ? my husband and i went there sunday afternoon . no body greeted us or told be right there . i wish i would of left then . the place was dirty .
bland food , unhappy waiters , ad a manager full of excuses ad no apology !
was my first time visiting the place upon moving out here . when i first walked in i was immediately turned off as to how dirty the place was , food on the floor , unclean tables .
overall it was a bad experience . they tell you anything to get the sale and once the sale is over so is the party .
they serve day old rice at times . since the ownership had changed things have gotten bad in the area of customer service . the chicken often has little vibes in it . the new manager is rude and doesnt speak english well .
dirty inside , nothing stocked up . gave me cold curly fries with my meal . they did however replace them .
did not have a great experience . i walked in for a trim and ended up walking out with really short hair . the stylist did not listen to my instructions .
this place is a joke and a rip off . find another body shop for your sake . do n't waste your time .
stayed here once in 2006 and had roaches in the room . now in october of 2010 my husbands company had an incentive trip . 6 people so far have been hit with credit card fraud !
so , i come into this location and the lady does n't speak a word of english , so my wife translates for me . i simply wanted to find out how much they charged for taxes and how much would i get in my return .
sushi is not the best . very poor service and very over priced ! never eating here . we had not even finished the first round when we were asked to order the second round .
very slow service . burgers come out burnt . i waited 30 min and still no burger . ended up leaving empty handed as i had an appointment to go to . others were also tired of waiting .
horrible . will not recommend or take my animals there ever again . i 'll keep this short : bad customer service , non caring attitudes , no responsibility of there actions if questioned , and overpriced according to skill sets of doctors .
worst chinese dim sum ever . very overpriced and does n't taste good at all . i 'll stick with dragon boat .
this pharmacy is a disorganized mess dropping off and picking up i had to speak to 5 staff members . save yourself some time and go somewhere else
i 'm in a way upset and relieved that i did n't get my wedding here .
attention all black barbers and black stylists i am a barber here in charlotte this is my profession that i love ! when i walked into this place i was treated like a thug !
alcohol is too expensive . the 11 $ drink did n't have any vodka . anyways . do n't go here .
the cashier steals from the elderly ! do n't give them $ 100.00 bills to pay for your car wash , they will say you gave them a $ 20 . horrible place !
nail techs were rude and seemed rushed . nails were done sloppily , had to pick off gel that was on my skin . paid for a gel polish and only lasted 1 week . will not return .
the hours are inaccurate . every time we make an attempt to go here , they 've closed upwards of thirty minutes before the hours on the door claim .
do n't waste your money ! my husband and i both thought the choreography was lacking and the girls could afford to practice their routines , so they are in sync with one another . as avid country music fans , we were very disappointed .
if i could give them zero . i would . this was the worse food i have ever had in my life . if i wanted unseasoned canned vegetables i would have went to target . and my food was cold to the touch .
oh , hey chipotle . thanks for breaking my heart with this $ 8.50 chicken and steak burrito the size of my hand . normally , i would n't care much , but this has happened on more than one occasion .
came here for some drinks and a bite to eat . sat on the patio , the server came and took our drink order . it took a while to get our drinks and then when we finally got them we never saw the waiter again .
we heard the pizza was good and we were willing to try it until we called for delivery . in order to do delivery , you have to order through a 3rd person . what ?
horrible service . only 1 order ahead of my 1 sandwich to-go and it took 25 minutes . when i asked about my sandwich the girl said they lost my ticket . no apology -- then it took another 10 minutes to make my sandwich ! 35 min .
i went in today to do a walk in and ask a few questions , i sat for 15 minutes with 2 babies under 2 while waiting for the not busy stylist to come to the front desk .
avoid cafe ! on two occasions iv been in for breakfast . raw sausage on both occasions . food comes at different times even when quiet . place is getting a bad reputation since they stopped the buffet and hired chefs '' . not nice !
large store with selection , but terribly rude employees . plenty of other toy options in vegas . avoid this one .
if zero stars was an option that is what this place deserves . absolutely the worst customer service and to top it all off they put the wrong oil filter on my car , which blew my engine and they refused to pay for it .
if you are thinking of using this bank to finance your home . here is a scenario you may want to consider . wells fargo has no understanding of how the real estate business works .
i 've tried this location twice . both times involved rude employees who seemed to be annoyed upon my arrival as they needed to put their conversations in hold . one time they screwed up my order and hung up on me ( twice ! )
i 've been to a couple of performances there & i like the venue very much . my major problem with them is the nickel & diming with the addition of 4 fees by the time the order for 2 tickets is completed .
simple order of spicy chicken nuggets and a small chili . i get a small chili that is so runny that it 's like broth and to top that off i was given no crackers .
this place is terrible . i have been here 4 times and each time my food has been cold and is so greasy the pita is soaked in it . the staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean but the food is very subpar .
went into blue banana on a monday afternoon and the service was terrible . i purchased a cute cat coin purse for my sister 's birthday and upon checking out there were two girls behind the counter .
had my very first bad experience . i called in for an order when i got there they gave the food to another patron .
second time i 've been here and ordered 'the vito ' sandwich was half ass made with no lettuce when i asked for extra . i also asked for additional dressing they rolled their eyes .
the worst bar ever . had to wait for an hour for a drink at the bar . they knew there was a special event and did n't prepare for it at all . never go here .
this is probably one of the worst dealerships i have dealt with ! i bought my first bmw here almost 4 years ago from henry . it is time to get another bmw and i really do n't want to go back into this place .
not happy at all . food very bland . service not happy . server was nice . but i ca n't see myself returning .
actually i have no comment on the doctor . i was calling to see if he was taking new patients and the very rude receptionist said it depends on the insurance . i told her aetna -she said no and hung up on me .
just went there at 11pm on a sunday and they said they were closing because they were n't busy . 3 hours early and nothing else open in plaza midwood .
i am going to avoid this store in the future and try other ups stores . the employee who was working was rude and clearly not interested in doing his job .
the customer service here is atrocious . we had to order three different times before she got the order correct . also , how can you possibly be out of chicken tenders ? what a joke this location is .
terrible ! awful service . this is not my first time eating at cookout . the onions were not cut the way they usually are , it was huge and at an angle . completely inedible .
do n't stay here i have given this place two chances and they failed both .
the owner and her husband are extremely unprofessional and rude . one time i tried to attend their class and they did not even bother to show up .
who ever designed this place should be out to death . no more restaurants ? just no service disgusting ipad areas ? no hostess no seats no nothing it 's absolutely disgusting . i will drive to buffalo over coming to this nightmare ever again
lousy equipment and terrible customer service . my six month old box had to be replaced . they told me they could mail me a new one free of charge or i could go in to one of their locations and get a box instantly .
the staff might be great if you have the time and ability to drive to the store in hopes that they have what you are looking for .
well this place sucks , i got serviced a raw teriyaki chicken bowl and a day old looking vegetable roll !
total rip . broke the lock . did not take off the broken lock , charged 95.00 . could not make the replacement key . this was a complete disaster . i will never call this company again nor will i ever recommend them .
three times in the last few months , i stop in and they have no crown royal . you had one job , lee 's . one . job .
sensory deprivation is very difficult when a subway train goes underneath you ever 45 seconds . unfortunate location choice for this business . i would go somewhere else if you are looking to relax . other than this major concern the experience of floating is like nothing else .
this is just on the basis of the madness of how they made an $ 8 smoothie : they added a heap of ice , which , you know is basically just filler .
never again will i come here as a piece of wood ended up in my rolled tacos .
my mom was just in there yesterday and they prescribed her some medications that were discontinued . so she called the office and ask to speak to the doctor about the medicine and one of the receptionist had told her that the doctor was at a different location .
what rude and inconsiderate management . i called a company that had promised to deliver something to us last week to ask why it had not arrived . they said it was delivered to the vue park west office and someone there had signed for it .
do not bring your kids here ! the doctor has terrible bedside manner . additionally , her staff is rude and unprofessional . i contacted her office regarding a discrepancy on my bill , and a gentleman by the name of oc '' was nearly yelling at me .
had horrible experience at the pier . their grill broke we waited 2 hours for our food which was cold . owners were very inflexible i even offered to split the bill they refused . very bad experience . supervisor offered to comp .
i 'm not a fan of this restaurant . the waitstaff are not friendly and the menu is not great . they do not accommodate anyone with food allergies . i 'm both lactose and gluten intolerant and the only beverage i can purchase is tea .
i want to give this store a negative rating . this is a horrible store . we have been sent three different places for a microwave and no one is willing to help .
do not order from them ! we were told our pizza would get here in 40 minutes and waited two hours ! ridiculous .
went here for a fundraiser . bartender was watering down drinks , and extremely rude when questioned about it . buffet was very poor . had to ask a waitress 3 times to bring out more wings and pizza .
salsa from a jar , refried beans from a can , stale and cold soft taco shells , and day old mahi-mahi chunks . plus a beer and corn chowder all for $ 30 .
i used their recent groupon for what they called a mini detail . '' this mini it 's me $ 140 total , and it was far less detailed than it should be , because right away i could see places where they had n't touched .
they gave me a 4 hour window and of course they came right dead at 5pm . they sent to me what looked like a kid fresh out of high school . honestly i could have done what he did .
price was excellent , but that was it ! front desk service is horrific , rudest , unprofessional rude individuals that work at the hotel check in desk . would rather handle all the phone calls coming in , then the people in front of them .
still no door on that toilet stall in the men 's room ? sorry but people do like to poop in privacy .
i found this place through groupon . i will probably never return . the store is pretty , but the actual service has been sub par . i got an eye exam & 2 pairs of glasses .
really good food . bad music . atrocious service except the bartender . we had about a $ 320 tab , paid cash , and then stopped after we left because they said we shorted them $ 100 . seriously ?
must be standard answer to bad service experience ! send us your email address and we will get back to you . never heard a thing !
really lacking compared to other pho restaurants i 've been to . i would avoid this place unless you 're absolutely desperate for pho in this area . their customer service really sucks .
definitely do n't go late at night . i 've been there twice after 9pm and the staff is horrible . i ordered my smoothie without any added sugar but they made it so sweet i could n't drink it .
i too was scammed by these criminals , booked and paid for a hotel room for a popular convention , then learned they canceled the reservation a month prior to the date .
i love starbucks but this could be the slowest coffee house on the planet . 30 mins to get a coffee is unbelievable and every time we go in it seems like the staff is always not even trying to speed things up .
stay away ! their cheap prices are misleading ! worst sales staff who do not know their products . make sure you research your product before you buy . do not trust what they say .
if there was somewhere else to go i would happily shop elsewhere . i have to agree that several of the staff are just plain unfriendly and rude , and for no reason . what an unpleasant experience shopping there .
shady . ask for the price to replace the hard drive on the imac and the guy said , geez , i do n't know how much it is off my head , but i will diagnosis for you the same day .
this location is awful . the people they have working here are beyond rude and management is beyond poor . how can it be parents weekend at asu and they have empty tables but can not seat because they do n't have enough people working ?
i went here on christmas eve for a uti , and they did not do a pregnancy test first . i told them i could possibly be pregnant on my paperwork .
very bad . .this was our first experience with this restaurant . we ordered delivery tonight and got a salad with all brown lettuce .
i got a horrible cut here . the stylist did everything i asked her not to do . it will be months of growing out before my hair looks good again . i will never go back .
he was supposed to arrive between 9-10 . then i get a text he 's running late due to family issues . fine . i follow up an hour later to get is eta and he said he 'd arrive in 35 minutes .
i will give this restaurant one star . even that is too many but i ca n't post this without committing to at least one . coupons given in compensation of a horrible first experience brought us back for a second try .
we wanted to grab dessert here but the service turned us off . the waitress was rude and were talking about us as we left , thinking we could n't understand them .
very bright cafeteria feel average food over priced we go every few years to see if things have changed . they never do reminds me of a high end nursing home cafeteria
we wanted to take my kids out to dinner this weekend and stopped at applebees since it was pretty empty .
when a business is closed for good , it should be remove from your listing ( radio shack )
get a second opinion told my husband he was getting better and treatments would go to once a month . he died two weeks later . nurse at the hospital said we should of been told at the cancer center how bad he was .
you might have to dip into your savings account if you get your dry cleaning done here . i have a couple of dress pants that they charged over $ 9 for . nothing fancy about these pants .
called to get price quote for a shave wash for my english bulldog . lady i spoke with told me she needed to see my dog first to quote me , but finally was able to give me an estimate of $ 40 .
they 're guys came through the neighborhood putting their cards on all the houses including this one with the sign stating to keep your business card and flyers . the signs in english and spanish so i guess their go to marketing guy ca n't read either .
i was excited about a new bbq place in the area . i ordered the blue ribbon plate ( a mix of everything the offer ) and my wife ordered the lite chicken plate . her food came out a good 5 minutes before mine .
well , we were craving chinese food , and i asked tried and true or something new ? '' we decided on something new , first thought was , geez , this place is expensive for the size and condition of the restaurant . ''
went in for drug test today was brought back by the lady working the front desk . she handed me a key then walked away .
terrible . paid 15 $ for one piece of lasagna which apparently comes with garlic bread and a salad .
i had a spring checkup and was told all was well . that night the air conditioner kept running and the temperature never dropped .
we were with a big group ( 15 ) , but there was no one else in the restaurant . it took 1 1 2 hours to get our food . something was definitely fishy about the bill process .
disgusting sums it all up . i was looking for a place to have lunch that was not fast food . i gave this place a try and regretted it . ordered the meatloaf and it was barely warm and the gravy was cold and like jello !
i went to this location one day to exchange something and i had bought . the woman at the customer service desk was not friendly at all and acted like each person she waited on was bothering her .
i go here when i need to pick up a prescription , but otherwise i try to avoid it . there is a shoppers further up on royal york that has better deals and much nicer staff .
ordered from papa johns when staying in phoenix . the cheese pizza was to be well done and we were supposed to have cheese cups with order . no cheese cups and the pizza was burnt .
its a scam . they are fishing for personal info . bought a ticket from sf to sd . good fare . one day before the travel date flight was cancelled .
today my wife went to this location . while the service was okay and friendly , there were only 2 female employees working . one on the front register and one on the drive thru .
ate here yesterday , the decor is nice . the food however . my friend ordered the bun bo hue , myself and another friend got the 88 special .
not only are the strings attached enough to hang yourself with , but the customer service was the worst i 've experienced . they literally hung up on me when i said i was n't interested at that price . free hopper ?
usually okay i suppose ? only been there twice . rated low today because today , the middle aged man cutting my hair got caught up in a chat with his co worker while cutting my hair and cut off my bang .
very dishonest people . will rip you off and make your car worse . they are a bunch of liars ! this company is a fraud !
if you care about your loved one at all , do not send them here ! the staff is absolutely horrible and the facility not well kept .
depending on what direction you are coming from this location can be difficult to access .
horrible . the restaurant was very tiny . good thing we were the only customers , while the restaurant next door looked packed . that was probably a sign .
i usually do n't write reviews , but i recently had a terrible experience .
they deserve zero stars but yelp does n't offer that option . i 've used this car wash several times out of convenience , however the service and quality of work is always the same . terrible !
deliver was lightening fast . i ordered a fountain drink and requested no ice , they sent me a cup half empty . i guess to compensate for the ice . i got gen tao chicken which had virtually no flavor .
worse service i have ever received . a three top showed up after our two top and were seated before us . two cups of water took 20 minutes , our server took just as long to take our food order .
this review would have been a two star rating but having not one but two dirty glasses brought to you was more than enough to bring this rating down to a one star . sorry copper blues tempe but the phoenix one never had a problem like this .
the guy worker was rude and they had no battery 's or were n't very knowledgable . not gon na go here again
that one star should be a negative 5 stars . today i realized why i do not fly this airline and will never fly with this airline again .
i have to say i had high expectations due to previous reviews on yelp when i went there .
i use to love this place . but the last time i ordered they messed it up , even after repeating it 3 times . then when i got home there was a black hair in my food .
good beer , however i could n't try more than one because of their extremely slow service . server asked if we needed another minute to decide , but after not checking on us for 20 minutes , we had to approach the bar for a check . disappointing .
when gold diamond first opened they had a great mix of cart service & menu selections . that seems to have gone away and they are now only running carts .
i usually am very satisfied everytime i come here . however this time around , i brought my baby and in laws and the service was so dang slow and horrible . im waiting with my baby for a good hr to get our food .
what an awful place ! came here after work to try their wings that the ppl in cleveland rave about and did n't even make it that far . we walk in and the energy is so dead , the bartender is n't friendly at all .
extremely annoyed . this chipotle is so inconsistent with their portions and the individuals working here are completely useless . i do n't know why i 'm so loyal to this location .
i made an appointment for struts , shocks and a c. my husband took our car in and after inspection , we were told we needed over $ 900 in other work . husband agreed and signed .
i feel so stupid even coming to this place ! this place is the worst experience i have ever had ! we called this place without checking yelp reviews first which was a big mistake .
maybe i will update this . twenty mins to close but was told that the kitchen was closed . not going for it . asked for the manager and would you believe that the manager is in china ?
had the jerk chicken lunch special . chicken was extremely dry . rice and peas was dry . plantain was all mushy . was charged $ 0.50 for using credit card . cost me $ 10.00 with plantain . ended up not eating the rest of it .
changing my review after a few really bad experiences here . one time included bring brought the wrong dish 3 times ina row and eventually having to eat after everyone else in my party was finished .
got drug into this place on saturday night . i saw one of the prior reviews ask , what the hell were we doing here ? '' we were all 21 once . that 's the only excuse you have for going to this place .
terrible . i visited before numerous times when it was a fox & fiddle . the only redeeming factor was that the menu items were decent . the service however was bad . guess what ? service is still bad and the new menu is extremely unattractive .
never used english . ignored me , customer asking question . if i wasnt in a bind for time , i would just have told them to fuck off . go elsewhere
worst sub i have ever had . i ordered one with ranch , instead of ranch it was smothered in mayonnaise and melted cheese . ordered the kids sandwich for my son and same thing , smothered in mayonnaise .
worst service experience . dropped vehicle off at 9 am and went to work . it was still not ready when i came back at 4:15 . all they were doing was an oil change and routine service .
lucky cab cost from airport to venetian - $ 27.00 with tip other cab service venetian to airport $ 15.00 with tip . i believe i was taken the long way around by lucky cab to get to destination .
i keep coming back here for the awesome food ! every time i come here i leave with a belly satisfied and i come to this one because it 's close to my place . unfortunately the guy at the register is always rude and has terrible personal hygiene .
shrimp salad was ok but the service was not. long story short. here 's a tip thai house , it 's never a good idea to argue with a customer . ever .
i am so disappointed in the way they handled my accident . i was told to do more treatment then needed , they over charged and when brought up keri was really rude and laughed .
i had a similar experience to the other reviewer .
one of the worst meals i have ever had . meat that has been showered with a creamy mayo based sauce . absolutely disgusting . huge portions of rice were provided with the meal - no flavor at all .
rude staff i brought my daughter to this location because of all the good reviews i saw but my experience was not a good one . i only made it to the front desk . the guy there was very rude and had a terrible attitude .
i agree with jamie c . beware ! my dog was brought in here , now has a cut on her ear . i spoke with the owner about this her exact words were this type of thing happens all the time in all groomer shops '' no !
i 'm not the person to complain but my last experience was terrible . i do n't get my nails done very often but when i splurge i expect them to look better than i can do .
this place is decent with typical cafe food , sandwiches , burgers , breakfast foods , etc . however , i have only been here when i was drunk at 4 am and every single time i am here they take forever to bring the food out .
the shop was dirty ! you can tell they never clean their stations . false advertising , they say they are giving you one thing and give cheap products . i went to get mt nails gel 'd '' they used some acrylic powder they pass off as gel .
preordered a pizza at 1 pm for 6:15 pm take out . they were very understaffed and way behind . my pizza was left on warming rack in the chaos and was given to me warm at 6:45 .
worst experience ever . while waiting for our lanes to open up ( they did n't reserve them for us even though we called ahead of time ) we sat at the bar . the bar tender is sexist .
should be 0 stars . low quotes over the phone increases a lot after you send an inventory list and you have already given them payment . when they show up to pick up your belongings , they will say our truck can not take all your stuff .
awful service !
my husband and i have bought juice cleanses twice over the period of a few years at salud in sewickley . we enjoyed them , however , when i returned the bottles for my deposit recently of which i paid for with cash .
this place is awful . if you are looking to ruin your nails , be talked about you in another language , and have overall shitty customer service , go here . lee may be the best '' at eyebrows but i guess an attitude comes along with it .
thought i was going to be original posting on here about the endless calls from different numbers ! i 've counted ! 17 times now !
when i walked inside this place , it was basically empty . i was curious to why this place was empty until i ordered my food .
do not waste your time or money in this poor establishment . they have zero customer service & i have given them three chances to prove me right . the only reason there was a third is due to an emergency before a wedding i was attending .
check out their yelp reviews for the other store in las vegas . use reviews there to determine if shopping at conns is a good thing . i believe one must avoid conns .
pizza hut cheese lovers is capital nasty . do n't order it unless you want something nasty .
they cleaned my dress and burned the arm then tried to cover it up . when i brought it to their attention they denied it . i will never go back to a dry cleaners that lies when they have damaged something .
horrible customer service . average food . i strongly recommend against eating here . extremely noisy because of a huge blender that is placed in the sitting area and not in the kitchen .
i was the only customer being served and it took almost 10 minutes to get a jasmine milk tea . there was a lot of chit chatting in the back .
i used to go here all of the time and it was pretty average food . the service was always pretty good . i went there today and i watched the waitress took care of the tables beside me and my family on two occasions .
everyone in here is right , it 's a beautiful store . one thing i must point out though is that the customer service is horrible . even the managers have poor customer service here .
ambience is better than average . quality of dimsum is less than impressive for north york .
the coconut milk in my drinks tasted watered down . the girls were rude and in no way friendly . i 'd rather travel the hour home to my moms and go there than go to this starbucks which is literally within walking distance .
the most unprofessional facility i have ever encountered in the healthcare profession ! multiple staff members talking loudly and openly in the lobby area about other patients - which is a clear hipaa violation .
a few weeks ago i decided to try this location because the ones in arizona were pretty decent . if you like hour waits , and terrible customer service come here .
terrible experience . staff is lazy . they actually seem annoyed to have customers walk in . then they have to put their phone down and wait on you . restroom floor littered with paper towels . bad vibe all around .
money grabbing place , charging for more drinks than were originally orders in attempt to make more tips , $ 20 cover on a thursday , $ 5 coat check . i would never come here again
we come here at least 52 times a year . lately things have been going down hill . today i ordered the short rib hash because i heard it was so good . it came out burnt to a crisp .
i saw a piece of furniture in the store a few weeks back , and went there today to try and buy it . getting to r & r for me is very difficult , because my days off are the same days they are closed .
worst insurance company ever . high prices , bad communication , and just do n't care . stay away !
i 've been to other mr. greek locations , so usually know what to expect . ordered take-out from this location and unfortunately the food was beyond awful , barely edible . ordered the gyro and chicken souvlaki meals . the chicken was undercooked , and pink inside .
the bouncers at the door are extremely rude . i went towards the entrance to see what the crowd was like . automatically , the guy goes where is your id . i said that i do n't even know if i want to come in yet .
i 'll never come back here . tried them out- and it seems they just make up their prices . advertised price for gel nails- was 23 $ . they charged me $ 36 . no full menu anywhere .
sales dept . complete thieves . 80 year old mother with dementia went in yesterday , and was talked into paying $ 30,000 for an optima , way over sticker .
this was the worst food i have ever had at a buffet ! i tried to tell the waiter and waitress , but they did n't speak english . when i told the chef the prime rib was not rare her response was that i came too early !
from the street it looks like a nice place but the staff thinks they know exactly what you want and try to push it on you . i just wanted to find a different pair of frames from the bread and butter places .
terrible . the teriyaki chicken was dry and the rice was over cooked . the meal came with two sides of iceberg salads ; one with teriyaki sauce poured over the top and the other was shredded with sesame seeds . not worth finishing the meal .
let me tell you something . hertz will steal your money . i had to rent a car from hertz after i was rear-ended on the highway . the first car they gave me i accepted excess insurance on .
update : i never received a phone call from annie '' or anyone from edible arrangements about my refund .
had gotten a quote over the phone with rick but when i came in to drop the chairs off the women at the front doubled the price on me . when i confronted her about the price she became irate with me .
over priced menu for subpar food 12 $ for a cheese steak sandwich and over cooked fries pass up
i normally shop online and found this store by accident . the females in the store interacted together in spanish while i sat there waiting on them to finish their conversation . jessica is her name , one of the rudest , laziest sales person i have ever met .
this office is completely unprofessional and practically announced that they were going to try to charge me as much as they can for needless testing . the doctor wo n't see me for a second opinion until i do needless tests .
checked in yesterday and there was bad customer service all around from check in to check out . stayed one night and woke up to two large bug bites on my lower back .
the bbq is very good , but the service is horrible . they wo n't tend to you if you 're not korean . i thought it was a figure of my imagination when it happen the first 2 times i went , but nope .
wow . went to look at this place this morning and i ca n't believe that they can rent anything . thank the lord that i yelp everything first then go and look .
third time ordering online , the tracker says its on its way then 10 min later someone calls & says they dont have a salad but my food was on the way 10 min ago first off . second , how you make my pizza ?
this place is terrible , i ordered shirts over a week ago and still nothing . i ordered another spirit shirt and still nothing . how can you operate a business that sells shirts for schools and still do n't have any .
do n't waste your time . the price is good but we had to tell them how many times we wanted my sons hair cut , ( high and tight ) hubby hair do n't get me started and he 's not happy .
if it were n't for yelp making me give it at least 1 star , this place would get zero , that 's right , zero stars . i have had one bad experience after another with these guys .
very very bad service , i do n't ever recall having such bad service ever at a nail salon . the lady told me that my little service would cost me $ 5.00 and when i went to the counter they had me pay $ 25.00 .
what a scam , i took a ring in to this location to possibly sell . the woman i spoke to had no clue what she was talking about .
signed up for their mosquito bait and kill which is all natural , safe for pets , etc . they should have called it bait and switch '' . they came out after i signed up for the natural product .
i am looking for spanish classes here in scottsdale , but i had a similar experience as the reviewer below . i got an email back from the director . ''
i would not recommend this place to anybody ! i was planning a special day for my sisters wedding dress shopping . i booked 3 facials for myself , my mom , and my sister . i made the appointments a month early .
this was a terrible meal ! i had the shredded chicken baja tacos . i asked for crispy tacos and i 'm not sure if they gave me the wrong thing or just made it badly . they used small flour tortillas . the meat was room temperature .
good food horrible waitress ! refused to help my kids crack there crab legs . i had to crack mine , my wife 's , and my two kids crab legs by the time i got to eat mine they were cold .
this was the 4th time arriving on a sunday between 4 and 5 to a half empty restaurant and yet told there was 30 to 45 min wait . during to the awkward time . really 430 on a sunday no servers 4 times in a row .
i have a total love hate relationship with this place . the food is pretty good , as most pickle barrels are , but the staff and the service is terrible !
my penne was swimming in cream when it was no supposed to be . no pesto flavour to be had as it was pesto penne advertised , mushroom was so thinly sliced could not even taste it in all that cream , no flavour at all .
biggest waste of money . ever ! signed up my whole family . paid a fortune . no results .
horrible service . my parents have been paying $ 49.99 every month since august and the have done nothing for us . and then we were only hold for over 20 minutes trying to get a hold of a representative .
went through the drive thru at 2:30 am and waited for about 5 minutes before anyone said anything or even attempted to take our order .
i bought 50 plasma tv and a fax machine from dell and they both are defective and they fixed my tv but still defective and now warranty expires .
i have placed exactly 30 delivery orders with you . i have spent , as a single person , well over $ 700 with you in the last several months . that is a good customer .
rude staff ! was waiting in line to checkout ( and we waited close to 15 minutes as the 2 cashiers were slower than the fast boat to china ) there was another woman in front of us and another behind us .
just watched one of their drivers sit in wendy 's parking lot on center ave scoping out the lot across the street . i went into wendy 's came out 20mins later he 's still sitting there .
ca n't make a burrito to save there lives . they need the san diego guys to come teach them how to make some good old fashion taco shop food . disgraceful to the roberto 's name .
would really like to thank chris for wasting my time by not showing up for a scheduled meeting to view a property they have been spamming craigslist with .
be very very careful when talking to this company . even if you get things in writing , they will ignore what was written and do whatever they want . their sales people are aggressive because they work on commission .
terrible service . i recently visited this establishment and and was very disappointed . the service was terrible : the every single employee was pushy and rude . i had a hard time getting my receipt .
if i could , i 'd give it zero stars !
if i was able to i would give this place zero stars ! the lady at the register was not knowledgable about the menu which was off putting since it was my first time and i knew more about the menu then she did , very disappointing .
stop signing a contract with this company . they are all nice and good before you make the first payment , then everything will change , they become rude , impossible to get a hold on , . the worst is the delay in completion of your work .
never again . i tried them once . i will not try them again . i was told 29 a room and if i wanted the pet treatment it would be 35 . when he was done the amount was a lot more than told to me .
have been a customer for over 13 years . have always paid too much . called today and they said they could lower the bill by $ 40 a month , but as long as i called to complain about my charges .
awful awful terrible food ! how can pad thai taste so bad ? this is thailand 's main dish ! they should be ashamed and embarrassed ! did take out never been to location and will never go back ! i give 0 stars not even 1 !
our family went bowling this past sunday , the person at the desk wanted us to buy the package '' which includes shoes and two hours of bowling . we decided to just bowl one game so we did n't need the two hours lane time .
been there 3 times and always a disappointment . food is mediocre and no service . all they want is your money . never again , no concept of quality except for the building and decor . stay away !
20 min wait for cold brew coffee just to be told they 're out ? then they butcher my iced coffee and use whole milk not coconut milk . should have taken my 2 dollar tip back . words ca n't describe how unsatisfied i am
thai tea tasted watered down and the chicken chow mien had no sauce no nothing on it . it 's was literally just like noodles and chicken and barely a serving of vegetables all tossed together but nothing tying them together .
i was in a lot of pain from a gout attack . i walked in and paid my $ 125 . waited about 3 hours and finally saw a dr .
food was not fresh , bland , and overall unappetizing . i love this middle eastern food , but this was a disappointing meal .
i found renting from your company to be the worst experience i 've ever had from a car rental company . unfortunately for me , fortunately for you , i had a prepaid reservation . otherwise i would have gone anywhere else .
the representative i spoke to on the phone quoted me a different price than what my actual bill is . i spoke to 3 people at cox repeating the story each time . they refused to honor the quote i was given and refused to see my side .
sales associate was extremely pushy . he was breathing down my back to give his store a 5 star rating and to post pictures of the store front for a free bath bomb . when i had the chance to smell the bath bombs they smelled terrible !
slow af ! wow ! never will return ! this place sucks ! longest drive thru i 've seen ! simple tasks seem to confuse the staff . and these ppl want $ 15 hr ? that 's a joke right ? cause i 'm laughing .
i really hate this place . the instant i pulled up i was swarmed with people trying to sell me stuff i did n't need . they would n't take no for an answer . so incredibly awkward .
the service at this place was terrible . we did n't have sheets on one of our beds , and the front desk person told us to come down and get one if we wanted .
i work at a pharmacy and have been referring patients in need of medical supplies to this place for years . i recently found myself needing their service while i was looking for a brace for my mother 's broken wrist .
i had few haircuts at this location . quality of work has been good and staff was fun to chat . however , stopped by on friday for a quick cut at 7:40pm and got turned away . posted closing time on the door is 8:00pm .
worst service i have ever had at a sushi restaurant . took over an hour just to get our food . when we asked where the rest of our order was , they said they were busy and to reorder it .
it says bright as day 24hour i was four cars in line we all sat in line for about 7 minutes then thought maybe the intercom system is down .
everytime i come here my order is messed up , shorted , or i am over charged . this time my fries ( see picture ) , was laughably short . i know i do n't need them , but still .
i got to the institute and the staff did many tests which they charged me for and i never saw a physician ! it cost me over $ 500.00 out of pocket and they do it without even asking you !
not a great first experience . took entirely too long . a customer that arrived after me was served before me . the walk up window was pointless as i was asked to come inside , then the barista helped someone in the walk up window .
i gave it one more try . was craving a pizza and ordered a margarita pizza to go . guy who took my phone order was friendly and upon pickup .
do not use this studio ! this place is terrible . the tech i used was so unprofessional i honestly believe she purposely put glue in my eye . she caused temporary blindness to my eye . she 's completely incompetent .
got a facial as a gift . sandra martinez has not been accommodating . she would not answer her phone . does not return voice mail messages . took multiple emails to get a response .
would give 1 star if it was possible ! this company tried to cheat me out of several thousand dollars in repairs - they said we needed a new compressor .
called on a tuesday to inquire about replacement sheet of glass for my tec grill . the gentleman who answered the phone said it would cost $ 149 , take about 3 weeks , and he wanted 50 down to place the order . then i called tec directly .
just wanted to update my review . since i last posted the carpet has started to come loose in several more different areas . mind you both my wife , and myself are senior citizens , and the only ones living , and using this house .
only after coming in for a free consultation did i find out that not only will they not work with insurance companies , they wo n't even provide billing codes for your procedure until after the work is already completed .
we had previously started using s & s tire exclusively for our vehicles and recommended them to others because of our previous experiences .
food always very greasy . staff talk in their native language in front of customers ( persian i think ? ) which they should know is very rude ! prices go up quite frequently . how fresh the food is depends on what time you arrive .
been on hold almost 1 hour and 30 minutes so far while i simply need to verify some information on my teen 's account expiration date based on activity . if there was money involved , i 'm sure they would have more agents available to answer the calls .
i have seldom experienced restaurants with worse service or a more unappealing menu .
do something better with your degree '' than prey on people and treat them rudely when they do n't buy . do n't tell your street contractors '' to promise things you ca n't provide then switch .
i 've given this place a few chances getting the same service and results every time . i will never be going back . the interior of my car is always coming out exactly as i brought it in as if they never touched it .
i walked into a pig sty of a place with barking dogs behind a small wooden gate . looked very unprofessional . i inquired about prices and they seemed very expensive for their services . i would not recommend bringing your pet here .
the good news is the music is blasting loud so you ca n't hear the person taking your order and it takes 10 minutes to do the order because of the super loud music blasting in your ear while you 're trying to order .
worst restaurant experience of my life ! disgusting sushi , with mystery fish inside . i ordered crab that tasted like tuna . very off . the manager there was so disturbingly rude , i would never in a million years recommend anyone to go to this hell hole .
received an email for a birthday offer , the cashier aka manager knew nothing about it . he would n't take a moment to listen to me . kept going back and forth . contacted customer service . made my complaint .
very disappointed experience at this hotel for our wedding . first , my mother-in-law slipped and fell because the server dropped the food on the floor without cleaning it properly . all we got from this incident was only an apologized email .
brides beware ! we had our wedding cake made by bakery magic . the service was okay but our cake looked awful ! it was such a disappointment . it looked nothing like we had discussed or imagined . it looked like it had fell over .
the place was small but clean . it was my first time there and i ordered two shakes ( one for my daughter and one for myself ) .
not impressed . first visit and waitress left a lot to be desired . was irritated at the very start of taking our order . small portions for the pricey menu . probably wo n't ever come back .
okay so here it is . i went to the pitch , literally to get the gifts like 98 of the people in the room . after hearing the salesman motivational speaker i was sold . just like the other reviewers , i did feel pressured .
this was my first time stay and was a huge disappointment . you might like the vibe if you are a hard core metal band or something here are the things that are real bad 1 .
oh my god , where do i begin ? i 'm all for nightclubs as long as the dj is good and can keep me from realizing that i 'm in a crappy a place !
came to get my eyebrows done and was totally disappointed . i asked her to just do a clean up and not to make them thin but she made them so so thin , i will not be coming back . i am so upset .
i am not a huge fan of dukes . i had to pester someone to help me and when i finally got help . the manager did n't bother explaining any of the bikes to me .
beware no matter what day of the week you come the food will take forever to be served ! second time coming and once again very disappointed . ive been waiting more than an hour for a quesadilla !
cute shop , rude rude rude baristas . skip this place , there are other coffee shops in walking distance .
this place is so bad . hot tea tastes like colored water . probably watered down 10x before i got it . only got xiao long bao and boy does it sucks . looks like xiao long bao but tastes like a steamed pork dumpling .
was excited to have ribs american style and they did not disappoint the food was amazing !
i have been going in here for quit some time . they have new bartender every time i go in . the place smells horrible and is run down needs some updating and a drain clean out .
i waited 30 min and forgot the order horrible service probably the worst bojangles ever and i will not come back here ever
we moved 4 months ago and had the service transfered to the new house .
i decided to go back to the auto shop to give them a second chance . i took my 1987 bmw that had an exhaust leak and no power to it .
i only went here because my usual place is closed sundays , i got a gel polish change on my hands , within 48 hours they were chipped and the gel was not hard like it usually is so my real nails bent and chipped .
really , really bad . drinks were so wrongly mixed that they were undrinkable , when i sent mine back for something else , it took forever to get the new drink . water was served without ice .
the worst experience ever . horrible staff , management as well as comedians . extremely unprofessional and horribly run .
the inside is messy . paper & food on floor . tables not cleaned . staff lackadaisical !
very bad ventilation . they beat the noodles in the dining hall without screen so you get a temporary hearing loss . maybe that is why the waitress speaks sooooooo loudly . the soup may look clear but it is very heavily seasoned .
warning ! do not come here anymore . my wife had a surgery done and it was totally messed up . dr kells told her , well we can try it again if you want . '' is that a damn joke ?
my mom had her hair dyed here last weekend , but when we got home we noticed that the roots were a completely different colour than the ends . the roots were orange and the ends were brown .
horrible ! i ca n't have hard broil egg with my salad when you have eggs here ! and just because i 'm not a hotel guest i do n't get first come first serve ! f you eggs slut ! you damn slut !
terrible car wash. my truck was just as dirty as it was when it went in . waste of money , waste of time . i 'm posting a pic of my hood to show how bad it is . do not go here , go anywhere else .
this place was not good at all . the food was cold and stale . the fried rice was burnt , not sure how that is possible , but it was . the crab puffs and soup was actually very good .
horrible customer service . 1 hour and 45 minutes for 2 pizzas with delivery 3 miles away . 1st and last time . wish i could have given less then 1 star .
disgusted by their customer service ! an employee was rude , forgot our order , unapologetic , gave us cold food , & made us late for church !
do not go here unless you want to be ripped off . postage shipping is 2-3x higher than normal ups usps . $ 7.50 to ship a light package that cost $ 1.95 at the post office .
this rental experience was beyond awful . customer service was very poor when i arrived and trying to get the car . agent was on phone and helping employees while handling my rental . method of payment awful .
sadly , i was treated quite rudely on the phone when attempting to book . i had an appt but rescheduled . the date i rescheduled for ended up not working so i called to reschedule again , about a week before the actual appt date .
this was my third time here and decided to try something aside from the burger wing fare talked about by other reviews . after waiting about 25 minutes the brisket burrito came out cold covered with a slice of american cheese .
we were very excited about the prospect of wings tonight and turned to yelp . sure enough : wing machine delivers . the wings unfortunately were disappointing . the were small , dry and tasted a little rubbery .
horrible service , malfunctioning tv , no blankets , wifi did n't work , broken fan in bathroom . this place has really gone downhill .
my home warranty company referred me to this company . never again will i use them , they are so unprofessional that its unbelievable . from the receptionist to the plumber 's , i dealt with 2 of them .
went to this location with my husband at 2pm on a saturday and there was a wait for the first time ever at a gg . the staff was n't overly friendly , but even the waiter did n't say 10 words to us .
despite the convenience of this store being close to the bloor yonge subway station , you would be better off shopping elsewhere . staff can be abrupt when asked for assistance , and the cashiers can be downright rude .
this place does horrible massages . it literally felt like i got rubbed down with lotion . will never return here again .
waited in line for 10 minutes to buy a pepsi while the clerk chatted with a customer . at least 3 others behind me waited too . there was another clerk behind the counter who did nothing but text on his phone .
told the cab driver to take the fastest way and opened google maps and the cab driver went the opposite way . $ 40 later , through the tunnel and on the freeway we got ripped off ! screw this cab company .
the service in this place is good , but should be as more staff than customers .
what a dump . came in for lunch today . we had the worst waiter in history . i think his name was jason or justin . talk about a hateful attitude . people before us walked out for lack of no service .
i 've given other smoking bones high marks but this one i can not . now i must admit at this one i never consumed a beverage because yesterday i sat at the bar 10 mins .
seem to be good but your nails will break in two weeks time , i 'm pissed . good service bad quality not to mention all the diamonds fell off after two days .
your pizza made my daughter sick . i called and the female manager ( did n't get the name ) said that sucks ! did n't apologize or anything . front desk staff was rude and disrespectful .
absolute worst pharmacy in the world . if yelp would let me leave negative stars i would . price of prescriptions go up every time you go in and you have to wait forever and they never good rx price that is posted online
worst service for people in a hurry . i called and placed an order for a box of coffee to go .
this barber shop is completely racist ! if you are black , i recommend you do n't waste your time . they will ignore you as soon as you walk in and act like you do n't exist . my husband had a horrible experience here .
stopped by again , hoping things would have gotten better . sat in a half empty bar for 10 minutes and left without even a glance our way . no hello '' . no nothing . i just noticed that yelp kept my review at 5 stars .
i have to say that my experience here was way less than sub-par . after being guided to the wrong type of glasses , and 700.00 plus ( after insurance ) i was instructed that i would now have to buy two pair instead of the one .
first of all i never eat mcd 's . i have it maybe once a year . i just do not care for it . i was having a bad day and was short on time so i decided to stop at this location .
place needs serious help , high employee turn over , quality of food has decline and if you only like conversing with men then this is definitely your kind of place ( sarcasm ) women just dont hang out here .
i was quoted 45-60 minutes for my order . it actually arrived at 88 minutes , and i 'm very close to the shop . when i called at 79 minutes , my order was still at the store . the manager was very rude over the phone .
realize , before you spend a dime in this place . there is a zero return policy . returned an item within 24 hours . they do n't take returns . no reputable business in these united states , would have a zero return policy .
vans are below standard . old & dirty . customer service is horrible ! long wait . when returning car you have to line up in long line all over again . first & last time renting here .
take this from someone who use to work there ! do not even bother going , save yourself the money , half of the games and attractions there do n't work or are constantly having issues .
the worst . their website is awful . try to trick you into thinking you 're getting a good deal . i hate that i 'm traveling tomorrow on this airline . trying to check in online was complicated and the constant up charges pissed me off .
they charged me after i cancelled my membership . i was physically in their location , filled out the paperwork and they guaranteed i would not incur anymore charges . and 1.5 weeks later , they charged my card . i am furious .
this place will go out of business soon , no doubt . prices are ludicrous and the guys at the counter were very interested in making a quick buck and getting me out of there .
really cool atmosphere . $ 5 cover to play board games which is awesome . one complaint . i asked our server about whether the fried brussels sprouts were good or not . she said yes , so i ordered them .
we had lunch in this restaurant , but honestly i do not recommend trying it at all . the service is absolutely terrible . only one waiter for the entire floor . our order was messed up . we had to wait too long in between orders .
came here tonight for dinner food has changed drastically . the chicken fingers were warm , green beans have changed . mashed potatoes were gross. the biscuit was not like i remember either . the only thing that tasted like it should was my pepsi .
even though the nice lady at the mesa office told me not to worry '' ; i knew better . no - my account was not corrected 7 days after nice lady said it would be . so i got someone on the phone in the collections department .
what a waste of time . walked entire lower and upper floors . not an employee anywhere . sad excuse for a retail store .
very rude and unhelpful workers . i would not go here if i do n't have to. but this is closest from my house and i need to get it done once every few years .
bad experience from the gate , bald manager i believe cory very unprofessional and claimed he had to move our tables for a fire hazard , shame we saw several other tables back to back .
service was a joke , after waiting for an hour i decided to get the hell out of there . they are all extremely unorganized with getting orders out . i 'm never going back to that bullshit place again , its just a big waste of time .
i normally enjoy coming to this location except when the heavy set mentally retarded cook is there . you have to repeat yourself at least 3 times and he still does n't comprehend . very bad customer service , the cashier is friendly .
the service is actually the worst . waitress has a bad attitude and my appetizer just took 45 min to come out . i had to remind her 3 times about it . would never come back
regardless of the day or time , it 's the slowest starbucks in town . nice people but terribly disorganized .
placed an order , paid , and waited about 10 minutes before the cashier comes to the table and says they have to close . the cook did n't show up ! why could n't the shift manager at least hop on the grill to complete the orders .
awful ! went in to see if they were on a wait for two , told it was going to be a 45 minute wait and was told that we could be served at the bar .
head to toe was recommended to me by a friend to have my 2 year old evaluated . a therapist came to my home and was very friendly and discussed my daughter . but nothing ever came from it . we never received an evaluation or diagnosis .
i am a very loyal chase customer . i made an appointment , was ten minutes early , and then waited another ten minutes after only to be told it would be another five .
this place has false advertising , had me walk 15 min in the cold , and was closed . they advertise 1am but were closed by 11:30pm
it hurts to even give this place 1 star . worst service ever ! it takes 25 minutes for a ham and cheese crepe ti be ready and they forget the sauce . i once stopped by to get three bottles of water .
saw american idiot tonight . it was really and i mean really loud . the story line was confusing and i left at the intermission . unless you are a dedicated green day fan and like obnoxious characters - avoid this play .
over priced $ 20 for basic cut . unprofessional barber shop . no customer service skills .
terrible moving company . not only did they charge me 3 times my initial quote , but the men who moved us took their time , taking longer routes , stopping for smoke breaks , very inefficient .
avoid coming here , the staff is to relaxed and has no sense urgency to supply good customer service .
kind of disappointed . the concept is great to make healthy meals intended for a person going to the gym . i felt like it was overly staffed with girls who just stood around and talked to each other . i ordered a lean ground turkey burrito .
this place has steadily gone downhill . tonight was the last straw . we were the only people in the restaurant , it still took over 10 minutes to get our food .
i came into here two different times and they were out of cheese .
the wait was reasonable and understanding but once we were seated the server took a while to take our orders . the first part of service was ok , but the food took about an hour an half to come out .
definite not retail although they advertise they sell retail . the lady was knowledgable enough on a few basic plants . we were looking at trees and were advised we could n't look at that area for insurance purposes .
took me 45 minutes to get an inspection while no one was in front of me in line . the girl working on my car was on her cell phone the whole time . she even stepped away for a few minutes to continue her conversation .
my boyfriend and i made a reservation three days in advance for our anniversary for 6:00 pm . internet and sign on door say they open at 4 . we show up at 5:50 and see two other couples waiting who say they are n't open .
this location is very convienent for me and the owner of the store , an older lady is very friendly and helpful .
avoid this olive garden at all costs . the host discriminates against minorities .
dish network takes advantage of senior citizens . my mother who is 93 years old and lives in a retirement community recently was visited by a company called walking retailers .
i went to chico 's when i saw they had free kids meals . when i got there i saw a sign that said kids meals 99 cents with adult dinner .
went inside the shop a few weeks ago and was extremely disturbed by the living conditions of the animals . the snakes were in showcases which should only be acceptable for a single weekend at a reptile expo .
not worth any star . bad service and bad attitude . what is happening with starbucks staff ? please just request a day off if you dont want to work on christmas . the lady was ok but the guy ignored me and just stared at me .
do n't waste your $ $ $ $ good shows which they are rarely never posted get sold out in 2 seconds .
i usually do n't write bad reviews , but the lady who did my nails did them horrible they were all bumpy and it looked like she was struggling the whole time . i do n't recommend this place
this place is a disgrace never come here again look at what i found in the soup a roach !
i wanted to give bww the benefit of possibly having a better experience on my second visit there . on this monday night visit i was with a friend .
missy was extremely rude when i called in to make an appointment . she acted as though i was an inconvenience to her .
terrible service ! i 'm not quite sure why i choose this place over others - perhaps it 's because it 's a national brand you would hope to trust . this is the second time i 've visited this location .
absolutely horrible ! this place is terrible about being on time . this is the second funeral we have been to here where the deacon was late . today he never even showed after postponing the service from 11:30 to 12:15 .
not much to say about a fast food joint that 's conveniently located all around town . this one in particular gave me food poisoning . i had the sourdough jack once and sadly i was throwing up all night long .
what a mistake and looking forward to something different . i really should have read the reviews before stopping . they serve out of a small refrigeration and did n't have what i wanted anyway . should have looked closer but walking around the airport and was too hungary !
we check into this hotel recently , everything was going well up until returning home to find out we was charge double for one extra night stay .
this place must be a front for something . the digs are lavish but the food and service are terrible . it 's always empty . how do they stay in business ?
i come in here pretty frequently with my boyfriend and we always have a nice experience . but last week when we went in , around 2pm wednesday , i 've never seen employees act so unprofessional .
if i could give this place zero stars i would ! the worst customer service ever ! although the place is clean and their clearance is good the manager and one of the cashiers do n't know their job !
walked in after work , after stopping by another subway which was not 24hrs anymore . i walk in an older man had sandwiches all over the counter preparing them ? and a woman greets me happily .
bad ! i have been using this salon since they opened . its close to where i live so its convenient .
not only is this a mcdonald 's so therefore nigh on inedible , but its a bad mcdonalds ! i have never had food from here that tasted good at all ! two pet peeves : they have no bike rack .
$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ how do they stay open with prices like these you wonder ? you pay for things and they do n't put them in your grocery bags , thats how .
i placed an order online to pick up copies shorty after . ryan let me know that he was very busy and could not get to it until after 5pm .
i came here after having friends talk about how good it is . will they must be just eating breakfast because i just ordered stuffed cabbage and it was so bad i could not eat it . i told the waitress and then she brought me a greek salad .
abysmal ! busses are always late . no compensation to those who spend $ 65 on monthly bus passes . leave an hour early and you might still be late ! ridiculous service .
chop shop ! do n't believe in industry standards . cut corners . drilled holes that are n't necessary in trailer . passed us on to 4 different service people for a super simple job ! extremely disappointed and will never use them again .
i have an event to go to so i wanted my pedicure to last through this weekend . it 's an hour before closing i asked for a gel pedicure the guy says we are closing , yes in an hour i only want a gel pedicure .
like the other reviews , this place has slow service . my fiance and i ordered a frappuccino and a cold brew .
this location was a total fail today . i placed an online order , go in to pick up & wait in line for someone to acknowledge that i 'm even there . then they are out of the coffee i ordered & paid for .
stop by for some curly fries ( craving ) after work , me and my boyfriend ended up throwing up all the fries that we had . it gave me a stomach ache and right after i threw up all the fries i felt better .
not impressed with the lady i got . trying to find a new barber and this place is not it . got frustrated trying to understand her accent that i finally got out of the chair and left . her response was oh boy '' .
been to several chipotles and was happy this one opened up so close at first . been about 5 times and they were decent enough the first couple of times to go back but will never go again !
delivery time is extremely inconsistent . 9 10 times my delivery is late . today it took 1hr 10 min for my order .
toppings galore ! no argument here . tasty ? forget it . this really makes me sad because its a newer biz in my hood and i wish those only success . no parking ! gal behind counter could have cared less if i was there .
i really wanted to like this place but unfortunately got the worse gel manicure i 've ever had . it was not neat at all , it ended up on my skin and all over my cuticles . two days later , it started to peel .
really over 20 minutes in the drive thou with only one car ahead of me . i know mexicans are slow but really .
as a new patient , i was instructed to show up 30 minutes prior to appt . i was also told that , if i cancelled for any reason , the doctor would never schedule another appointment with me .
we keep giving this place a chance , and finally , they have worn us out . we went there on a saturday night with our toddler .
this place was not good at all . as a salvadorean , i have eaten many pupusas in my life and the ones i ordered were horrible . honestly , they were the worst ones i have ever eaten .
went to pick up a prepaid car on the snow chaos weekend at the end of february 2015 and was about 6 hours late due to cancelled flights ; the car with the baby seat was given away ; given a replacement but no baby seat .
it 's been a little less than a year since i 've gotten the repair on my phone and the screen has definitely fell apart .
i have been coming to astoria since the early 80 's , when they were still next door and they use to serve a delicious garlic bread with the meal . the portions were generous , well cooked and the pork souvlaki was the best in town .
i heard that the pad thai is a safe option . the red curry beef with mango was not , from my experience . would n't go back or recommend .
i have an hour lunch spent 25 minutes in the drive thru with one car at the window . finally got to the window to see a cash only '' sign taped up there . i do n't carry cash ! he never opened the window .
i wish i could give less than one star . all i can say is dont move here .
we have tried this location at different times of the day , but consistently got the same slow service . today will probably be the last time we visit . .ordered a cucumber mojito smoothie .
total trash . do not come here . with so many other options in the immediate area , skip this shit hole . bad food . overpriced . long wait . flat out shitty .
very disappointed . the last time we shopped at this place we had a great experience . this time was bad . if you 're going to put out records , at least do the research and price the lp 's before putting them on the sale 's floor .
what a disappointment . it 's not the first time i order from here but it will be the last . i do n't know if they changed the owner or chef but the pizza was such a let down .
bad customer service , bad food , we order pho chicken for the little kids and we got a huge bowl , there is no favor at all . it was straight out of a chicken broth can . i order the crabmeat noodle soup .
extremely slow service . food sits on the shelf for what seems like forever while they prepare the rest of the meal . was served cold hibachi chicken that was plated 10 minutes before they served it . for $ 18.95 , i at least expect it to be hot
i wish i would have read yelp before going in there . this place is dirty ! they keep their tools for pedicures in a tool box that is very dirty and does n't look like it has ever been cleaned .
the worst customer service i have ever received . i 'm a manager and i always do my best to make sure my customers are happy and i did not get that service at this planet fitness .
so sad , maybe it used to be good ?
their products are always good . decent price and good quality . however , their service is always very bad and they 're very unfriendly . have been there multiple times yet i always end up having an unpleasant feeling when walking out of the store .
if i could them a minus star i would . this drinks itself is ok . waited almost 40 mins to order my drinks through the drive thru then took another 30 mins to make my drink . this location was the worst ever .
this is the worst place . i work grave came here to eat on my 30min lunch . waited in line to eat leaving 20min left . come to find out they wo n't take my debit card . gave some excuse . fuck you ppl !
i came in here the other day and i knew exactly what i wanted and was ready to buy but since i look young no salesman came out to help us .
horrible . my girlfriend and i came here tonight . there was a huge party . we waited at the door for 10 mins . no server was in sight to assist us as they were both busy with the party . we finally sat ourselves . and waited !
i ordered the lunch special mongolian beef . it was like look for the beef under a mountain of onions and dried noodles '' lunch special . the meat was bland and lacked any flavor of the hoisin or soy sauce .
we got some samosas from here today and were not impressed . very oily and with 0.75 for each samosa , they were pretty expensive as compared to other places that we have tried .
epic fail ! 1 . the order took my address wrong , not by number , but entire streets . 2 . order taker took apartment wrong 3 . buzzer number not recorded 4 . almost no beef in kung po beef 5 .
tried to use my bank card for amount over my balance and was declined but two days layer i 'm still trying to get the pending '' transaction off my account . they blame the bank , the bank blames them !
i use to go to this location all the time until i realized that the money you spend for the size of the scoops just kept getting smaller . they actually measure every cup after they scoop it .
brandon , i do live in southern california but called for mortgage in arizona . i either spoke to you or one of your employees . unfortunately , my description of the account is accurate and i will . it take down this post .
although i 'm not a tenant , i think customer service speaks loudly about what a place may be like . this morning i had the unfortunate experience of having a flat tire .
- was in the annex , and had the sudden hankering for some indian food . - their buffet lunch for the two of us was about $ 25 - all your standards dishes are there ( i.e .
one server , one bartender and one chef was not anywhere near enough to serve this small venue . most of the food was quite overdone . at least 10 parties left without being seated in the course of 90 minutes that we waited for our food .
made the mistake of calling this company without checking yelp first . called at 1:30 for a tow and was told it would be 2 hour wait . 4 hours later they called and said it would be another 45 minutes .
same thing happened to me from the above comment . ended up spending more than 3,000 dollars in repairs . i would not recommend this place to anyone . i am writing a complaint to the dmv to help resolve the matter .
first time coming here . i was there from 1:15 to 4:30 just for a gel pedi and gel fill . it was insane how long these people took . my pedicure water was boiling hot !
i am absolutely outraged by the experience i had at your establishment this evening and have never been treated so horribly at a place i spend my money on a regular basis .
you 're entitled to your opinion and so am i this pig sty is poorly managed . the staff has big time attitude problems . the owner , is the root of all problems and issues . my ethics . my standards : every business starts with one star .
been waiting for recall service . said it would be 2 hours . have now been here 3 hours and the service rep just said it will be another 25 minutes . question . why ca n't they just be truthful on the progress of your vehicle repair .
overbooked and the staff is horrible , not the doctor not the medical assistant the office staff ! put on hold for over 15 minutes ! the intake ladies look so miserable being their they want the doctor to pay them an extra .50 cents an hour to smile .
called multiple times to make an appointment , no answer . stood at the front door with my phone to my ear only to have the stylist ignore me ; and it 's cold out !
was advertised as rooms and bathrooms remodeled , the room basically was with flooring and end tables but all else was old . the bathrooms omg were not remodeled , were moldy old and nasty . see pictures . the front desk girl awesome ! cleaning staff very sketchy !
my experience was prior to even seeing a doctor . i never made it past the waiting room . arrived 30 minutes early with all paperwork completed . after waiting 30 minutes past my appointment time i approached the front desk and was asked .
total shit hole . so dirty . disgusting . i went here based on positive feedback . uhm ? i have nothing postive to say .
a total disappointment . my expectations were set by the many , many raving reviews , but it was a waste of money . ordered the montagu and the ingredients were very skimpy .
very unethical told me that they tried to fix my refrigerator but it was going to be a big job the next guy i called fixed it in 10 minutes would never call them again . stay away from this guy !
the mooresville office is so unprofessional . after i scheduled my surgery , the front office treated my very rudely . dr. slovak was never there , and the receptionist never would call you back . i was stunned . i promptly cancelled my surgery !
i 'm super upset , this bank does not allow you to deposit cash into anyone 's account unless you bank at chase ! it 's ridiculous ! my friends in a jam and i ca n't put cash into her account !
worse pharmacy ever . arrived at 8:20 pm for a simple prescription . i was told without even looking at my script that they could not fill it until tomorrow . they closed at 9:00 . terrible customer service . many issues with this location .
someone here is an idiot . cashier repeated , wedges . '' receipt says , wedges . '' but i come home to find their horrible fries with a sad amount cheddar '' substance and bacon on top . this was my diet cheat . ''
when this place first opened was great , but now it 's my second time horrible food , and it 's zero customer service from the manger as well , hoping the owner can see this comment and change this this bad staff
my coworker and i ordered them for delivery today . big mistake . i ordered the shrimp po'boy . the bread was so dry it crumbled into bread crumbs when i tried to bite .
worst dennys ever . the coffee was terrible . it was at least 2 hours old . i did n't drink anymore after the 1st sip . the rest of our party thought the same .
this review is only on the alcohol ( beer ) and not the food . my friends and i have been going to joeys recently and we noticed something about the beer . it is watered down , yes . .sad but true .
i told them to first pre treat the collars of my shirts to make sure they get cleaned . he waited until after j pre paid to answer my question . he responded with we ca n't guarantee that the neck stain will come out .
very expensive , take the time to go somewhere else and you 'll save a ton of money . everything is marked up at least 100 .
the restaurant had really bad smell and was very messy . when i started eating , my drink fell down accidentally but unfortunately the waitress did n't come for cleaning . i cleaned the table by myself but no one pay attention to the floor .
stopped by for lunch the other day . placed my order and went out back to wash up . the restroom is like an old gas station where you need to ask for a key and walk outside .
i 'm not a strip club regular but shit we look down from our crib and it 's right there so my cuz and i check it out one night . honestly i donno how this place stays open . nasty drinks .
we had a worst service and worst food , we order 2 fish and chips which there was no taste of fish and stake wasnt done how we asked .
if you are in the mood for some really bad mexican food you may have found your place ! wow- what a horrible way to spend 80 bucks on dinner . i do n't think anyone finished more than a quarter of their meal .
every time i get take out , i swear i 'm never going back but i work at a hospital in oakland so if i do n't take something to eat i need to find something quick .
we live in the neighbourhood so have been going here for a number of years . i think this past year something has happened - new owners , or several new owners perhaps .
we ordered a pizza a little after 5 . paid by credit card and got confirmation of the ordered . they showed up 2 hrs later and said that the machines are down and we have to pay cash . oh and they wo n't take a $ 50 .
rip off . they will try everything to knowingly over price your purchases and tell you good luck no return policy in the end .
massage was hard , ran on too long , and their credit card machine did n't work so they copied my information down . waste of time and money and i do n't feel safe with them having to write down my info like that . immediate buyers remorse .
beware ! do n't get any warranty work done by this company .
do n't know a lot regards to this place except do n't trust them . i got flowers delivered to me for my birthday from this place . they were given my complete address including apt and cell phone . i was home all day .
this would be a 5 star review if they got their sh t together and had their red sangria available at all times , instead of being out every single time i go . this is unacceptable .
my friends , my husband and i visited this coffee shop on 1 january 2017 at around 4pm . the brunette waitress who served us there was very rude from the very beginning .
worst moxie 's location ! waitress was slow in our order and when we spoke to the manager they did nothing about it . i ordered a bottle of wine for a celebration which never came . who waits til the entree in finished to remember the wine .
i could write a novel about the horrendous experience but i 'll keep it short . eli trucking significantly increased the price of our move the day of the move . they broke , damaged and lost some of our belongings ( several thousand dollars worth ) .
found the staff to be rude to the point i wanted to walk out without eating my meal . almost did except we were with other people . watched the manager owner put on her makeup and lipstick while i ate my dinner .
i am a young , single mother in debt because of this gym . i tried a free 3 month trial but had some financial issues before the 3 months was up . i have been given the run around about canceling from multiple people .
i used to go here regularly . now i can never get an appointment . you ca n't even get someone to answer the phone half the time . not cool .
i got their group buy deal for $ 5 for $ 10 worth of food . and ordered 4 items , they charged me money for a takeout box , plus they forgot '' one of the items , so i only got 3 items instead of 4 .
zero stars is not an option . i can not understand why it is so difficult to serve a good hot breakfast from a company that has been doing it for years . the food was cold and nasty .
worked at the kmart across the parking lot . my coworkers got a burrito there , and found a bug in it ! ewww !
ok we have a consistent problem with this mcdonald 's . specifically with the coffee . and that 's too bad because mcd 's coffee is typically very good . today 's problem is the decaf . old . very old .
worst clinic i have ever been to , ambiguous and high service charge , a 15 min cleaning plus x-ray cost 600 $ plus , they did all those without even asking me and confirming the price i felt like getting scammed by this dental office .
i am quite certain that this has been closed and is now the damon 's which i reviewed earlier today .
i have taken my dogs here for ever and loved the vets and staff . my dog suddenly became very sick on a wednesday , morning and i knew that the office opens at 7:30am . we got there early and waited .
the worst hotel in las vegas .
fix it or close it , but do n't just ignore the place . la fitness has operated this for over a year and there have been no improvements at all . it 's actually declining in quality .
first off they do n't have an office '' where you can wait so you have to walk down the street to hang out at the wendy 's for two hours . second , they only washed half of the outside of my car .
i had a bad experience in this place . i took my baby to this place to see if she liked it or not . it was a free play gym time not a special class .
i would not recommend this hair salon . i wanted a simple layered haircut , and came out with a uneven chops and blocks . i should have realized when i walked in no one was waiting in line that i should have turned around and went somewhere else .
if i had the option of no stars i would have done that . i went in to get parts for my side by side . i was greeted by a nice girl named megan . she went and got the so called parts manager tim .
this place is horrible . they forget about you after they put you in a room . they gossip about patients . what about hippa act and privacy of others . im so dissatisfied with this place .
dr. ganem is very arrogant and condescending . he comes off as inconsiderate and rude when you meet him . he may be a good doctor , but he lacks character .
burnt soggy and uneven . greasy to the point the box it came in was soggy . extremely disappointed .
if you love chipotle like i do , dont eat at this location . by far the worst chipotle location that i 've ever visited .
this is really bad pizza . it 's barely better than frozen pizza quality . i do n't understand what the big deal is about this place . the best pizza in arcadia is a few doors down at my slice of the pie .
i went in for a new swim suit , i walked the entire store trying to find them and not one associate bothered to ask if i needed help , instead they were all chatting up front at the register and hidden in footwear . typical sporting good retailer .
this place looks nice and the staff is nice but the skill level of the nail techs are terrible . i spent over 100 bucks plus tip for a pedicure and solar nails .
terrible . first time anyone ever messes up my haircut . i do n't think these women have any formal training in hair cutting . i will never go there again . i have to shave my head now
i really had a bad experience with greyhound , when i was in nyc , waiting for my bus to go back to montreal .
this burger king has consistently made errors with my orders . i do n't always have time to go through my bag and pull everything out and check . also they will serve you food that has been sitting out that is room temperature such as burgers .
very disappointed in the service and attitude of the older male technician . he was incredibly rude and tried to change the price of a full set after it was already started .
this may not be the forum to express my disappointment but here goes . performance was excellent . what i could see of it anyway . seats were terrible .
blew it ! they did n't even show up to pick us up . then they were completely rude when trying to figure out what happened . do n't waste your time with this company choose another !
i am waiting on a banker to talk about issuing a temp card . i 've been waiting at least 15 minutes . one lady is helping a customer and the other is sitting in her office texting .
party of 5 went in for lunch on a saturday . waitress was friendly ( at first ) . took longer then expected to receive one wrap , one mac & cheese with bbq wings and three burgers .
love this place but the girl who helped me was soooo rude .
not sure i can give this mcdonalds even 1 star . you 're in the drive thru for an average of 10-15 minutes . no joke . not worth the stop at all .
my wife and i went there last night . we had a 545 res and decided to have a cocktail at the bar since it was only 515 .
yes , it 's convenient , has parking , and a good selection of foods , but it 's insanely overpriced and the staff are condescending . there is one cashier in particular who is incredibly and consistently rude . i wo n't be back .
this place does n't stock well at all . not to mention customer service is very poor .
went here with my friends . was n't a busy night at all , aside from our group . there were 13 of us . i was n't drinking because i was a dd . the server was awful . she told me i had to order a drink .
not a fan at all . my first time here and i was sorely disappointed . first -- can we say lack of seating ?
if you have an iphone4 , i would say steer clear of this establishment . i had my not even two day old iphone4 stolen in a split second . it happened so quickly and this person that did it was a pro .
very slow in the morning ! with only 5 ppl in the whole place . i did get a coffee which was good , however my breakfast sandwich was double what i would of paid at any other location and was horrible .
the food is great , but the service is awful . it took almost an hour for our order to be served even though i pre-ordered it 1 hour prior .
i was in vegas for a wedding mid december and needed to get a manicure . i get manicures about every 2-3 weeks but i was pressed for time and decided to get my nails done while in vegas . boy was that a horrible decision .
worst nc bojangles i 've ever been to and i 've been to dozens across the state .
horrible , read the other reviews . i wish i had read them before i picked our mover . our move was best price movers of chicago . smooth salesman to get you to sign up . made a move from virginia to chicago .
if i could give it a negative 5 star i would . if your in for some major head damage , no service , lies and promises an a piss poor job this is your place . do n't say i did n't warn you
the club is super small , dark , and dingy . crowd is young , and immature . there are always fights and cops swarming the place . would not go to this place , unless i was still 19 and wanted to meet slimy ppl .
this review is limited to co2 refills only , since that 's all i 've had done . avoid this place at all costs for co2 refills . they do not weigh the tanks because to make sure the proper weight of co2 is added .
the food was awful ! too much fried foods and not much vegetables . no variety . taste like any other bad chinese buffet . not going back again .
we came as a large group for a post work get together on a sunday afternoon . the sun was shining and the patio set up awesome . that however was the best of it . our waitress had no concept of service .
service was slow and the food even slower and it was barely room temp when we finally did get it . it 's denny 's , so you ca n't expect the food to be amazing , and as far as denny 's goes , it was okay .
we rented the three bedroom penthouse unit for a family thanksgiving vacation . the unit must have been rented as a frat house before our stay . it was absolutly disgusting ! the furniture was ripped , collapsed couches with broken legs . the bed box springs were shot .
they left my fiance 's car with the door open and keys inside outside for ten minutes . as five men continued to work on one vehicle they all were hovering around . how many men does it take on one vehicle ?
i have spent my past 3 visits here telling myself meh , its just an off day '' . after my last trip , im just done . done and done .
i love carl 's jr always have , never have i had a problem with their food , well today i went and orded a famous star combo . fries were hard and dry . ok so i put those aside , whatever .
wednesday night at 9 pm no iced tea , no donut holes , no flavored donuts , burning hot coffee in a sleeveless cup and clerks that needed to hear our order 4 times in drive through before they got it right .
i got sick from the food , it was not worth the meal nor all the time i spent in the bathroom last night .
made appointment online , no one responded . went there anyway and waited 15 minutes in line to find out it could take several hours for an oil change . fail .
i suggest you do not use this company if you want your house fixed . this company has horrible service . they were referred by my friend 's insurance company so we thought they were good . they did some work on the flooding of the ac .
ok , so i usually do n't say bad things about a business unless it is the most extreme case . this is one of those times . without too much detail , i was accused by raymond the manager of coming into the store with a broken screen .
watch out when you buy in the forum shop ! at first , service is good but when you have a problem with the shoes . they are nasty . carol , the head of the store did n't let us return or exchange it .
walked in at 2:30 when the place closed at 4:00 . the girl just said sorry , i 'm done for the day . i thought it was kind of rude .
worst experience ever . $ 7.99 a night for wifi that cut out constantly , the ethernet hook up in the room did n't work at all . no complimentary breakfast . will never come back .
i drive out of my way so i dont go to this mcdonalds ! how can you seriously get the same order wrong 5 times . a manager was yelling and very unprofessional with a new and training employee . it 's dirty and bad service
my boyfriend and i came into los olivos today and had a bartender named miguel . he was incredibly rude to us , to the point where we felt so uncomfortable we decided to not order anything and leave the restaurant . we will not be coming here again .
i pretty much hate going into this store . the prices are cheap , but man the employees are rude . it 's like they 're trying to ignore you the entire time and get completely irritated when you try to ask a question or for any help .
i actually never got to the point of actually getting anything done . this place acts like they are doing you a favor by being there and lets be honest , vegas has it 's fair share of great places to get piercings done .
absolutely horrible products and service . i 've ordered from overnight several times over the years . the last two times have redefined the term bad business '' .
it 's gross ! i 'm giving them 1 star just because of how they handle the food . i do n't know if i wan na eat my chicken bowl anymore . a bunch of kids working there that day 8 8 15 !
i usually do not rate places when i travel . but this place deserves a bad rating . was in town for business . food- not good . service- eating dinner instead of serving me . pretty bad overall .
second visit . first time long wait but plenty of open tables . this time i was seated with no waiting . the new drinks were good but my meal took forever to arrive . no forks no knives . meal was cold .
hostility from various cast members towards my 11 member group . does not allow vaping , yet their smoking section is a few feet from the non smoking section and you can smell the smoke from the farthest point of the non smoking section .
this sephora is dirty dirty dirty . looks like someone let their kids just smash sh t up all over the place , and no one even took a rag to wipe it up . everything i touched or popped open was smashed and smudged and just plain grimy .
well we showed up for our 12 pm apt and the lady at the front desk told me the doctor was 40 minutes late . i asked ypu did n't call to let us know ? the receptionist was rude and said oh well we dont do that .
i purchased almost $ 200 in flowers from the shop for valentines day 2013 .
they were hired by my home warranty company to fix a dryer and dishwasher . the guy came over , spent 15 min with the machines and left . i 'm assuming he blew it off since my wife was at home ?
as a critical care nurse and nurse administrator i have to say i am ashamed of what i saw in terms of nursing staff in the er . i came here with a relative and experienced what seemed like a bad dream . nurses were rude and argumentative .
poor quality food . tacos are literally pitas from the supermarket topped with ground beef and unauthentic garnishes . fish , short rib , regardless poorly seasoned and mediocre at best . for an authentic experience try playa cabana on dupont street or el sol on danforth .
terrible service . no greeter . no one tending the bar . sat and waited entire room of guests wondering what was going on
we bought a new home in the beginning of this year . the developer used gothic for the backyard that we designed . one plant was n't actually planted in the ground so it sat in the plastic container without access to water and died .
i am completely new to town , and i had an appointment at 9:15 . my schedule is nuts with starting school and finding an apartment and i have to leave to go back home for my sisters wedding so i needed a wax asap !
worst customer service of any paint store i 've ever been in as i 'm standing here being helped the guys goes into the back and started calling people .
owner is rude , short tempered , and abrasive . the selection is n't even that good . 0 10 will not be returning .
nope ! never again . i went in this morning for a fill and a pedicure . the young lady who did my pedicure must have been having a bad day because she looked annoyed that i required her to work . no hello or conversation .
horrible service . took 45 minutes to check me in and then they took someone before me because he kept complaining . extremely unprofessional and no one seemed to know what they were doing .
i just had the worst experience at this store . my husband and were walking down main street with our nephew .
$ 5,000 of furniture with broken pieces . i suggest you look over every inch , inside and out if you buy anything ! customer service is not good , and the prices are expensive anyways . please do n't shop here
its an applebees . go somewhere else . slow service and flat beers . good for a quick lunch but better dinner spots are walkable .
i called to make a reservation and i was treated very rudely . i was very disappointed . i do not deserve to be treated this way . i left a message for the owner , albert to call me .
basic americanized bland chinese food . tastes like p.f . chang 's frozen entrees from target . service is good . portions are large . no shrimp egg rolls !
so disappointed by the miscellaneous barn in painesville . quoted a price one day . four days later want $ 220 more . wo n't budge . they instead offered slightly discounted delivery . they find good furniture but charge a hefty price for it .
it was n't bad for my first time ! i had a gift certificate so i went . i enjoyed that they offer drinks !
there is nothing positive i could say about this food . i have never had such low quality chinese food . everything tasted the same and sauce was greasy and slimy . today i regret eating this garbage and wasting the calories .
thought i had found a fantastic place to purchase a used washer . paid cash which is the only thing they take other than check . they said they 'd deliver next day in the morning between 10-11 am .
stopped for a beer here after a flight got pushed back an hour . ca n't speak for the food , and the mill st beer is good , but i can speak for the service . and it was horrible .
came to this location & there is nobody that does smog . we looked up this location , we called to see if they were actually open . this is the 2nd location we have gone to .
you 're telling me i just paid for a $ 10 car wash and you do n't wipe the car any longer . i guess it 's good you pay 5 employees to help me use an automated screen and sit in the office .
they billed my insurance twice normal rate . then what the insurance did not pay they put a lean on my insurance from wreck . then immediately sold it to a broker company . i warn you watch out for these sharks . it cost me 100s extra dollars .
after a year or so , i decided to give another shot of this joint , since i 'm around . no surprise ! same cheap ownership , same under-staffed . watching the poor servers running like crazy chicks is not helping the appetite .
called to confirm that the self-service car wash could be used for rv . no answer to several attempts . then because the rig was filthy , i decided to go anyway .
never fails on friday afternoons , they always have just one worker trying to service all the kids that just got out of school . good ice cream but takes forever to actually get it .
this guy is a scammer . he sells through online agencies and gives fake confirmations . if he can sell the room for more he does and then he cancels the others . do not book .
ordered a 2 without onions and tomatoes . order was even correct on the drive-thru screen yet they gave me a 1 with onions and tomato . how do you fuck something up that bad ?
so they ruined my mexican pizza ( see picture ) and gave me 3 sauces for a mexican pizza and 2 burritos . after she asked me how much i 'd like and i said a lot . worst fucking taco bell ever .
we went here around 9pm , i love fried chicken so i decided to have a popeyes . while we are looking at the menu ( driving thru ) he decided to give us a attitude , when my husband said ok we are ready ! ''
so i had a car accident and my insurance provided me with a rental till my car was fixed . went to enterprise at this location , picked out the car , and hes explaining the contract as my wife is singing .
horrible customer service . they ca n't confirm a scheduled time until the day of the appointment even when you schedule in advance . that means to get service you have to be available from 7 am to 2 pm . hello ?
not sure what happened here , but the pizza has become inedible . my husband and i got take out tonight of a plain cheese pizza . i took 3 bites and was done . it was way too salty to eat .
drinks only - we ordered the lime margherita 's . first : we were n't asked if we wanted them frozen or on the rocks .
i would put negative 5 stars if yelp system is allowed to do that . how we got to know this company as our ac is from sonoran air and we called sonoran air and sonoran air then sent goettl to fix the ac .
place was disgusting ! room was dirty and the maid forgot to clean it before i got in . this made me so uncomfortable ! not recommended
food was sub par , one step up from taco bell . the drunken nachos were ok , but hard to eat . the main courses were not spectacular . mojitos tasted like a cheap sugar mix .
worst service staff ! waitress took our order , never handed to the kitchen . waited almost two hours , waitress disappeared and did n't check in with us or kitchen on the order . supervisor that was working did n't care about the poor service either .
witnessed miss treatment of employees on multiple occasions from management from a hefty manager . will not return to this location .
not impressed . big sign outside advertising $ 9.99 passport photos .
very dirty bar . most of the bartenders are just texting and could care less about the people spending money . filled with smoke and it is dripping from the ceilings .
worst , slowest service ever . i had limited time to get food before a 2.5 hour flight home , and i ordered a simple quesadilla , waited 15 mins and ended up refunding it to catch my flight . angry , hungry , annoyed .
ordered mushrooms on burger and fries , it arrived about 60 seconds later , luke warm with cheese unmelted . meat so tough the knife could hardly cut it .
loser burger ! after the customer ahead of me was finished ordering the girl working the cash looked at me told me it was her break and walked away on her cellphone .
super disappointed with their exchange policy . i shop here a lot for work and have always been really happy .
worst dining experience in years . 15 minutes to talk to waitress . took order for table next to ours that sat 10 minutes after we did . over an hour wait for food . mahi mahi was swimming in sauce and vegetables under cooked .
went there for an oil change . the district manager help us while he was visiting the store . he told us 3 times he was the district manager . he made a joke that was kind of insulting .
warning . the service is really bad in here . my husband and i came here for the first time from maryland .
missed pick ups , seemingly all the time . customer service is ok , people were polite . but overall big corporation does n't seem to care about the customer
what is it with these stupid cleaning companies that are n't capable of doing business ? this review is merely based on a phone call - if you 're overbooked , be competent and hire staff .
very rude staff ! needed assistance and went to the counter . waited while the two women were talking , i moved right in front of them and they continued talking . then one finally looked up and stared at me for me to ask my question .
literally the worst customer service ever ! i 've been to many jack in the boxes and this has to be the worst !
i purchased a bed from this company . it arrived damaged . the screws provided were made of pot metal and stripped while assembling the bed . the upper center support beam broke free after 3 days .
worst apartment complex ever . we are counting the weeks until we get to move out . i 'm paying so much for a shitty apartment . the apartment is falling apart . and when something breaks , maintenance puts it off for weeks and weeks .
walked in with a friend on a friday around 4 for happy hour . sat at the bar for over 5 minutes and not one person acknowledged us . the place was not busy at all . one guy at the bar eating nachos and drinking a beer .
the atmosphere is nice but the service is awful . waited 20 mins to just get a drink order . after ordering drinks we had to go and ask for the waitress to come back to order food after waiting another 20 mins .
do n't get the pistachio . it tastes fake . to have a staple flavour like pistachio taste like theirs is a total disappointment .
i do n't live in lv , but i called to find out some information . very unfriendly individuals who answer the phones ! i guess television makes people this way . not cool at all !
no stars . when i called they said it was $ 99 cash and $ 75 on card and it would take 5 days to get my card .
this company will do anything to make their daily quota . they charge customers for diagnostic test that they do not perform . after having repairs done here , i feel like i was ripped off .
one of the worst hotel experiences i have ever had . granted one does n't expect four seasons service or amenities at this level , but is it too much to ask for a little respect , compassion , and a room with a working toilet ?
awful service . color of the spray tan came off very quickly , was uneven and streaky . would not go back .
update : orange theory has since refunded the fee they withdrew from my account . it took a lot of effort but finally did the right thing because their records were incorrect .
closed at noon , when there are lights on and sign states that you are open . watched as numerous other confused people pulled on the locked door , waiting in drive through .
just dealt with jessica in women 's department and she was probably the rudest person i 've ever met . you can do better dillard 's .
i love their hot and sour soup and so i order from here regularly . i decided to get the mongolian beef today to try something different . never ever doing that again . 90 onion and 10 beef .
do n't go to this place ! had a small get together and they do n't except returns after 7 days even if it is unopened ! this company should probably rethink their policy of products if it is unopened .
hotel does not accept local customers . i had an ac problem and needed a hotel to stay in close to my house . receptionist looked my dl and told me mgmt does n't allow locals to stay . .smh
absolutely rude people that work here . rather than asking me for assistance she sat and stared at my shirt . i do n't feel that i should be discriminated against for what i 'm wearing just because it did n't fit with their standards .
our experience here was horrible . liz gave us the worst service . she is not polite , she never asked us if we are doing ok , even when our beer was empty . she decided to go and acknowledge everyone around us but us .
came in for a late snack at 4pm . the dumplings were cold and had a lot of msg . the lettuce cups were marginal . staff was barely courteous .
i went there because i bought a groupon and it was n't far from me but i would never go back . the food was pretty much inedible . i was starving so i managed to eat a slice which i now regret .
these are a bunch of liars and cheaters i purchased an extended warranty that covered nothing they 've had my car for months and months will never return my calls and now want to try to charge me to store it .
closed this el paso is now closed . i heard others have as well . too bad . the catfish could feed a family of four and was actually pretty good . as was the bbq sauce . a little bummed to see it go .
i just ordered a pizza from this store . after an hour and a half of waiting , i called in and was told that my pizza was sitting on the stores counter . the order was placed for delivery and the store manager confirmed this .
first time contact lens users beware ! do n't expect to see as good as having your glasses on and be ready to compromise on how good your vision can be .
by far the worst falafel i 've ever had . shawarma was n't better . looking at their shawarma turning oven you 'll see it 's been traveling between fridge and oven for at least two weeks . what a waste of time even writing about this place . shame
i was a previous store team leader at target and had one of my worst experiences at the location on w. bell rd . today .
do n't ever go to abe 's shoe repair on guadalupe and mcclintock ! they lost my $ 40 sandals i was going to pay them to fix .
absolutely awful . worst service i have had in a very long time . breakfast took at least 45 minutes and it was not worth the wait . i just had a simple bacon and eggs , both that were undercooked .
lindsay drove thru wait i 've ever had , and there was only one car in front of me ! something needs to be done about proper staffing .
the sad demise of a wonderful restaurant . today we went to green bamboo for lunch . it 's been a year since we went there last . we were a regular at this place . the place is no longer what it used to be .
this site quoted me at one price charged another then refused to do a return after telling me that i needed to return the vehicle first . all the employees were pleasant enough but i learned my lesson and will n never rent from hertz again
this company is no longer in business . the sign has been taken down , and the landlords of this location said the company has closed shop for good and moved to california .
beware of the device department here ! they tell you one thing and charge you for a hell of a lot more ! we were told was only going to be 140 got charged over 300 ! this place is absurd !
avoid this restaurant at all costs we arrived to this restaurant with a group of 6 people for a birthday dinner . we were told the food was great and huge portions . we were seated upstairs and our appetizers came relatively quickly .
vermont sandwich company was friendly about taking the order except for one major issue . i had a coupon that stated buy one sandwich and get one free with purchase of two drinks .
the place was very busy , however we manage to get a table after waiting for 15minutes . after we order our food we waited for half an hour per dish . the food was not very good .
do not eat here ! i came in and ordered takeout , while making one of the dishes the to go container fell in the floor and the man cooking picked it up and put it back on the counter to fill !
was wanting to try out a new gym . i decided to stop by this location just to check it out .
the sugar factory charges for water , and charges an extra tax just for the privilege '' of eating there . they 're charged a tax to operate on the strip , and they pass that charge onto their customers .
warning ! this store is a complete 100 rip off they delivered a broken love seat and i even paid extra for a full warranty .
went there with my husband for dinner for its good rating on yelp but felt so disappointed . if it is possible , i will give 3 negative stars to this place .
my neighborhood is managed '' by vision .
yuck . the only thing good about my meal was the tap water in a big cup she gave me .
i live right next to this location and there is never anyone there . growing up in ca we drove far to get to one and there was always a 30 min wait . my son gets a donut after school and they are always hard and stale .
if you are chinese do n't go here ! we got lost finding this place inside the palms . who knew it would be a restaurant in the back of a restaurant .
the service was slow ( they were n't that busy and we still had to wait around 45 minutes for our food ) and menu overpriced ( but it 's vegas , i know ) . i got the lemon butter shrimp and i absolutely hated it .
american residential properties is horrible and unorganized . they told me i was approved , excited for that . then i called in the next day and they told me i was n't approved . horrible service .
absolutely horrible . highly recommend paying a little more and staying with cox . i 've only had cl for less than 6 months and had to call for technical assistance 4 times .
wish i could give 0 stars . lost my business forever ! workers do n't give a shit and randomly jump into races leaving no one attending the track .
this place was very good before , but not anymore . they started doing $ 5 express takeout and $ 3 breakfast and last week they changed menu ( not reflected on website yet ) .
i so wish i would have read the negative reviews before i signed up with these idiots . i have had nothing but problems since day one . i was very specific in what my needs were concerning credit card processing .
gross food . not authentic mexican food at all . i did n't like it one bit . to each her own though .
rude ! could n't follow a simple request when asked to separate the order in two bags because they 're going to different places she failed asked her twice . when asked how munchkins are sold reply was i could buy 4 .
this place has gone down hill terribly , food was not prepared well , no flavor , it was delivered cold and the service was worse than the food . nachos were 7 11 quality .
being platinum elite with marriott does n't matter at this place . it 's a nice property and well built , i 'll give them that . other than that , wo n't stay here again . the air conditioning does n't work .
do not use this dentist . i wrote a good review on them originally but after 2 trips to them , found they were not as good as i originally thought . there are a lot of dentists in vegas , please use one of the others .
terrible- the worst . tried to force me into insurances , offered me special rates , but only if i would take their insurances , ended up walking down the corridor to another company for a quarter of the price
so slow . so bad . not much more can be said . yelp requires more words before this can be a review so i 'll say it again . so slow . so bad . not much more can be said .
just walked in here this afternoon . horrible service if you call it that . walked in two guys just quickly glanced at us and then went on to talk about their personal business . ( no one was in the store ) .
smartest thing i have done in a long time . quit this nasty smelling , things never working gym talk you into $ $ $ for trainers that do n't train you consistently what a rip off .
terrible ! took my money and did n't deliver what i ordered . fraudulent pizza company ! do n't pay till you check your order .
i 've been there several times and they are horrible , the last time i had fallen down the stairs and hurt my back , elbow , shoulders and knees . they told me to pick one and they would check it out . wtf ?
new bar in area . food was horrible . table was dirty . bartender ca n't make drinks . wo n't be running back unless i hear it 's better . too bad it 's in my neighborhood and i 'll have to skip past it
this is my second time visiting this location . my friends and family came with me and recommended this place . i attempted to order the karaage bowl last week , and there was no rice ( in a japanese restaurant ) so i changed my ordered .
the owner is a complete a hole the whole restaurant staff and manager told us he is an alcoholic that beats his wife i live in the kierland flats and have never had worse service in any establishment . the food is nothing great .
when you order actual food from this panera bread , please , watch their hands .
the food was alright , but no pork at this place ! only in the egg rolls ! lady says they do n't serve pork because , wait , wait , because the muslims do n't like it ! wow ! this is america we eat what we want !
i do n't recommend living here . the office is not helpful and they are rude when you need things done , i made appointments and they never come or call . it 's really expensive and not worth it .
this company is ran so shady , if not enough by one is canceled , owner acted like she owned my establishment and was rude to my employees and she 's the owner .
the lady ( tattoos on her hand ) working the drive thru is extremely rude . she was rude taking my order and soon as she gave me my food slams the window .
bid on an online auction from these people and paid them on march 3 , 2015 for the invoice and shipping . despite two emails and two phone calls they have not bothered to reply to let me know if it has been shipped !
first and last time in this location . i went in to see if they had a particular item and no one seemed interested in helping me .
rude , ignorant , argumentative and unprofessional are the words that come to mind when dealing with the manager of this place . if i could zero stars , i would .
we hired healthy pools to complete a project by thanksgiving . it is now march 26 and they still have n't completed the job . during this time they were supposed to continue care of the pool . it has been cleaned once during the past five months .
horrible sevice ! just shopped for an hour . then while in line being the next customer up , cashier took a person that was n't even in the same line . said that they were here longer .
called to confirm that a 2010 equinox was still available . the person i spoke to confirmed that it was available and said he would have someone bring it around front . drove 45 minutes just to be told that it was sold the previous day .
i would give it no stars if i could . i get terrible service here each and every time . had to come the past five months and everytime they have been rude and do n't even take a second to try to do their job .
very poor service . long line , all video kiosks were down . then , i leave a sweater in the car and let them know the very next morning , to only find out that they rented the car out without even checking it first .
3 22 14 dont come here . bartenders have bad attitudes . i ordered a white russian and it was made with vanilla vodka and soy milk . it was foul . the bartender tried to argue with me about how my favorite drink was made .
i ate here during the wells fargo championship at the event . it was he worst beef brisket i have ever eaten . do n't waste your money on this place . the customer service was terrible they had the nerve to be counting trays and foil .
homeowners beware . do not use this company , scam artist overcharging massively . very pushy it makes you feel like you have nowhere to turn when they arrive .
i ordered the hummus which was delicious . i also ordered the hell 's kitchen burger , medium well . well let 's just say that my burger was a rare as when it went on the grill .
maybe we just went on a bad day , but i 'm not sure how these reviews are so positive . my friend and i went to ken 's after seeing the good reviews on yelp . the place is dark and not very sanitary .
honestly , anytime you have to wait in a drive through for 20+ minutes it is just bad service ! then wrong order . ugh . i thought it was a fluke , as i stop every morning . nope ! everyday for 2 months it has been horrible .
where to start with this starbucks . i go to starbucks every day during the work week to the one by my workplace . maybe even twice a day some days and the service is top notch . but this starbucks sucks !
everything about this restaurant was poor except the friendliness of the server . the food was spiced badly . no dishes and cutlery is n't cute , it 's gross ! hot food served in a plastic bag ?
despite the positive reviews on yelp , we had a bad experience with the taco man .
if i could give zero stars , i would ! alert to anyone needing anything printed on cards for personal or professional purposes , stay far away from this company . they are very unprofessional . i recently used them to order business cards .
this place is borderline being a dump . ok it is a dump . it 's old , rundown , cash only , shady parking lot , and it 's just simply not clean .
the food here is absolutely horrible . worst chinese food i have ever tasted in my life . will never eat here again .
food was tasteless and there were only a few thin slices of mushroom in the mushroom fried rice dish . they do n't know how to make real fried rice . maybe they think that they are in a non chinese area so they cn get away from it .
we are not complainers . that being said , we ate at the market district restaurant . burger was not good ( so not good ) and salad was abysmal ( wilted and only filled half the bowl and this was a dinner sized salad ) .
avoid this rv rental place ! we rented the rv for 3 days . upon return they claimed that we damaged the bumper ( but the scratches were already there ) and charged us additional $ 1800 .
the waitresses are friendly . the kitchen is super mega ridiculously slow . ( takes forever ) . the food is not out of this world .
staff was cold and unfriendly . limited selection on essential oils . will not go back .
worst customer service ever . there is an older lady who is just a witch to everyone . treats customers like they are just bothering her . fixed the issue walked away and wo n't eat here .
been going here after work friday nights with colleagues . noticing the service in the bar is very slow and drinks and food take a lot longer to get to you then they should . we def . wo n't be visiting anymore since we were served raw meat !
horrible services .
my 1st experience , 2004 , was awesome ! i bought another car about 4 years ago , lemon , lemon ! i returned it the same day and was told there is not a lemon law . ahhh , yes there is !
you had better check on your free 3 day pass '' sam tried to charge a $ 20 day fee even though we had printed pass . i would like to cancel my membership .
this place looked awesome online . the website said the playground opened at nine but when we got there they were closed . a lady came out and said they do n't open until 11 .
i love sushi ! and this was definitely not the right place to go . i went here once and ordered fried calamari as an appetizer and sushi . the calamari had strings in it , was extremely slimy and chewy .
for a burger specialist it 's terrible . if you want a hamburger make it yourself guaranteed to be better then this place .
i was compelled to write a review because of the horrible experience i had . i do n't like to complain about small issues but this place has got to have the worst customer service .
lines are always long and slow here and it is even worse since the closing of albertsons . do n't look for half gallons of milk . they never have any . super bowl sunday and there are 5-7 people deep in each line .
we received a quote that was outlined with the issues accompanied by pricing and it was so expensive we canceled doing the work and were charged a trip charge .
update : alright , i went back . the cashiers were nice this time , but the food still sucks and it does n't look like management is going to do anything about it .
really ? i have been to this location a few times now and have realized that if you do n't have 2 to 3 hours to spare just for a tire change do n't bother going !
we have been to this co co 's several times over the past three yrs and each and everytime it seems to get worse .
if you need a place for one night and price is the only consideration , then it meets the requirement of a bed for the night . if you think your getting an in room kitchen and clean room then spend the extra money and stay somewhere else .
yikes ! dont bother with this small little bar ! i was here at 2pm . .the menu is meager , my burger was cooked without an ounce of flavor , my onions were frozen and the lettuce was a slimy brown color .
pharmacy : awful service today . dropped off perscription at 10am for pick up at 12 noon . came at 2pm and not only was it not ready , it took 30 minutes to fill and then they only could fill half of it .
possibly the worst service i 've had in years . the worst i believe is the owners wife , who has been extremely miserable every time i 've had the misfortune of eating there . food is good , but not worth the experience .
this is the worst nail salon ever . i sat in their chit for over 45 minutes and it was n't until i was putting my shoes back on and getting my shit together that anyone bothered to attend me . terrible customer service
my husband and i went last night based on rave reviews here . huge disappointment . shrimp was cold , over buttered and way too much garlic . ahi tuna was pink in the middle . tough on the outside .
worst customer service ever . i 've been calling for months . on demand does n't work . i called complained they blamed it on my internet . i now pay an extra 40 & a month to up my internet .
go somewhere else . do not waste your money . this place was horrible . hookers where running around . i came out my room and there was a bum sleep in front of my door in a chair .
once was a five star now a no star . the office is sending my 50 dollar balance to collections without even asking me about my situation . who does this ? no smiles here as far as i can see .
not sure what is going on . took my dogs in 2 weeks ago and they were having a problem with their credit card processing machine . they said i may be charged twice and if so just give them a call and they would issue a credit .
we ordered two lunch specials for delivery and it took two hours for it to be delivered . i called three times and kept getting told they would be there soon . that 's unacceptable .
changing names to avoid all of the negative reviews and issues with their business . this company is a scam ! do not use this company . they treat tenants horrible , hide the truth from the owner of the property and hurry you around left and right .
very very bad , lazy , slow service . the servers took an hour for our food to come to us . on top of that , their floor were very dirty with a lot of spills on the floor .
the one star is way too much for this place , the most horrid food i have ever had . panda express is fine dining compared to this .
absolutely terrible . food bland , service horrendous , inside dull . avoid .
let 's keep short and sweet : empty at prime time on friday , horrible service , mediocre bar-b-q , and the old fashioned tasted like watered down whiskey and water . will not return .
by far , this store is consistently the worst chipotle i 've ever been to . service is slower then molasses , crew spends more time talking amongst themselves then working on orders and they 're always out of something .
service bad . orange juice worse . food is their only saving grace . if you get the orange juice you better specify small or you will pay $ 4 for a glass of pulp .
this rating is on their new self checkout . i have been a shopper and avid costco enthusiast since it 's days as price club . i love the place ! but . recently my costco put in self check which is ridiculous !
want a simple ffl transfer ? then run ! go to bear arms . took 2 weeks and 3 separate trips to the store including a 3 hour wait at the dmv . i waited 7 months for that rifle .
really really bad food . went there last weekend . owner sammy is cool , not too sure about his wife who looked scary . i had already known she couldnt take any criticism so sending my food back was out of the question . go somewhere else
i have used this location before and pick up a few good pieces . i recommended this terri 's to one of my older customers and she was basically robbed .
annoyed that they did n't even check me in . all the lady said was be with you in a moment . 15 minutes i walked out and went to great clips ( way better experience there ) on horizon parkway .
first off ryan at the front desk is the only positive to mention . he responded to our issues and resolved the mess with our reservation .
if you are expecting a good smoothie from jamba , turn away ! this place may have the name , but their product is not what i know jamba to be .
they did a nice job on the haircut until i got home and realized that the barber burned or cut the back of my neck along my hairline .
i went there two times and they where closed for some weird reason . so i wonder about a place that makes its own hours rather then follow the hours it has posted . i would not recommend this place .
this tanning salon is pretty lacking in beds 2 for high level . groupon coupon was a half lie . and i had to pay taxes once the coupon was redeemed . i never payed for a monthly cost and only been able to use services at 1 location .
staff was neither pleasant nor rude , but was more or less efficient and i got in and out in a good amount of time . the food was no good though . while it was a good portion , it was pricey .
i walked in , and there was 1 cashier for the entire store . no self check out lane . i literally walked out after seeing that . there was a huge line at this 1 open cashier lane .
more like stress zone . i came here for my 19th birthday with my girlfriend in october , we got facials and a 1 hr massage . cost well over 300 dollars .
staples has the worst prices on copy paper . they want to charge you $ 56 dollars a box then give you a $ 35 rebate .
the food is n't all that great as i hoped it would . i ordered a steak burrito with pinto beans , brown rice , pico de gallo , sour cream , and cheese .
this place should be avoided at all cost . nearly every time i order through the drive through , they get my order wrong . i get off work in the am thinking i am going to get a double whopper with cheese . nope .
my 4 yr old and i picked up my 6 yr old from school and went there for lunch today . they both had nuggets and fries . 30 mins later both had projectile vomit . just plain wrong
1 ) bad barely warm food 2 ) luckily little seafood as frankly the length of time some of the food out there was suspect 3 ) vegetarian options include chips , rice , noodles , omelette and one vegetable dish horrible food . wo n't be back .
i come to concord mills at least twice per month . i love concord mills ! this is to tell people do not go into heaven scent !
this review is solely based on the way i was treated by the maître d ' . i left immediately after having to interact with him . his condescending manner and style of addressing us on entering was so incredibly rude that i lost all desire and appetite .
i checked on yelp if carls jr was open thanksgiving & it said yes . came to the drive thru and some one told me to look over the menu and let them know when i was ready to order . i waited . and waited .
cox is among the worst customer service providers i 've ever met in my life . if you have the opportunity to select anyone else to provide cable do so . there is no customer service . ''
ladies beware . went back today my experience was a bit different , i went alone and wish i wouldnt have the man that rubbed me today rubbed my breast not a little on my chest plate my actual boob ! yuck !
beware , this cab company took me on a long haul all around the city on my trip from the airport to the strip .
do n't waste your time . arrowhead mall on the other side of town is so much better !
do not shop here ! i have had to return something each time i shop here ! they do have good prices . however , their stuff is defective . i was kicked out of there for demanding my money back ! what the hell ? seriously ?
this place is a rip-off . $ 95 to take in 3 pairs of pants in the waist and butt . the only reason i had it done was because i needed the pants .
had to wait an hour just to find out the phone i wanted to get for my 12 year old , that is on display is n't available . store does not have enough seating or waiting areas to accommodate the ridiculous wait time .
they are very rude and not worthy to go to them , i want to replace my lens because it got scratches . the worker did n't smile or even said hi .
do not eat here . perhaps get a latte here if you want a patio to smoke on . certainly do not allow yourself to be misled by seeing the words omelet '' and goat cheese '' on the same board .
all the foods were cold . need to get a good chef . too many items but none are acceptable . better have less item and get good quality and taste .
i 've been to this place twice . first time i left thinking it was alright of a place . not the best , but it was n't the worst either .
i came in for auto accident injuries and was brushed off by the doctor . the next day my symptoms were worse so i went to the emergency room and was treated for a neck sprain , concussion , and back injuries .
this place is horrible a guy wearing flip flops and being super casual cutting hair ? i do n't think so . the guy that cut my hair seemed like this was his first week of using hair clippers .
worst service ever . food came out at different times . some were almost finished when the rest of the table got their food . management was rude . our waitress only came to our table 3 times .
i ordered a small arrangement from this location a week in advance , with chocolate dip and bowl on the side .
i would give negative stars if possible . there was a bug in my food and they wanted me to drive it to the store for a partial refund . terrible service and i am disgusted !
this is the most filthy and disgusting place i 've ever been ! there 's no way it 's actually up to code and standards . i came in on a whim one day to get a pedicure and left completely disappointed and disgusted .
this location has closed .
great clothes , but awful customer service . i 've been in this store twice and been completely ignored both times . i appreciate some space when i shop , but not being treated as if i do n't exist .
my husband and i made an appointment for a consultation last week . we arrived on time and waited 50 minutes before we had leave . big waste of time . absolutely ridiculous ! we will never use this firm for anything .
downhill . i 've been eating at luke 's a few times a month since 1996 . over the last few years , it 's slowly been going downhill . their signature italian beef sandwiches are often served barely warm or cold .
arrived to find a massive clump of freshly shaven public hairs in my bathtub . cleaning staff went home early so i had to clean it myself .
i love chipotle . but we just picked up food to go and the rice was so undercooked it was crunchy . the guacamole was so salty its inedible and my sons pork was so dried up it looked shiny . if that makes any sense .
food was really subpar . i had the enchiladas and it was literally tough to eat . the enchiladas were drier than the sonoran desert and i probably would have had an easier time trying to cut through an armadillo shell .
make reservations at 7:00pm . make us wait for another 30 mins for the table . horrible service at hostess front , bad attitude . foods is alright . there are many in the area . wo n't go back for sure .
great wings . good pizza . friendly service . clean tables and floors . however , the bathrooms are nasty . i would have given 5 stars , but dirty , moldy toilets . ick !
how about 0 stars ? i came in to pick up a package and of course i did n't have the tracking number . i received instructions on how to go about getting it .
can here sunday , on tuesday my nails was cracked by wednesday it popped off . i came to the nail salon and they told me they are way to busy and to come back later !
50 dollars worth of disgusting food . ordered a dish with shrimp got chicken . wonton soup terrible . food terrible . awful awful awful . egg rolls were burnt . awful food . super disappointed
do not go to this shop if you want more than tires . i went and was told i needed a lot of work on my car ! they quoted me almost $ 800 in parts and $ 400 in labor .
i went to popeye 's almost four years ago and i had good service . last saturday . no !
i ordered mushrooms , apparently they come from a can . i ordered spinach which is cut up into little cooked sprinkle . do n't come here if you are expecting fresh gourmet '' ingredients .
went to this place for a birthday but it was not a celebration . the service is very poor . food came extremely late and we think it 's because the waitress completely forgot the orders .
horrible customer service . came here and felt like a criminal after they chased after my 1yr old to take a ballon away from him that he picked up off the floor . made my shopping experience very unpleasant .
why is it no matter when i come in there is always one teller . could be 20 people in line . they do n't care . to many extra personnel walking around . tell the manager to be a teller and stop observing . very badly run branch .
this place is horrible better off getting pizza from a chain restaurant . over priced and not very good .
this was a good idea , but what a waste of money . $ 30 or so for an hour of jumping around . i found that way to expensive . the staff seemed disinterested , and that made the expense more boring .
i called this company on saturday morning about 7:30am because my window was stuck down and needed a repair right away . the person i talked to on the phone took my information , said et me check on prices and give you a call back by 8:30am .
i would n't give any stars , if i could . by far the worst chinese food i 've ever tried . portions are ridiculously small for the prices . the employees made sure to shake any excess '' off before placing on the plate .
i 've been shopping at this store for 5 years . they have changed managers so when i wanted to get boxes i was told that they are no longer giving boxes away to their customers .
my daughter left my three-year-old dachshund here for , at the most , three days and nights in the small dog room . my first complaint is that no one goes in the small dog room to watch the dogs for any consistent schedule !
serendipity does not always pay off . i was hungry -- what 's your excuse ? the big boy restaurants of my childhood were passable , possibly even fun .
worst service ever ! after engine repair , they broke wiper . i noticed it during rain after leaving dealership . not a big deal , one trip back to dealership and they fixed it .
watch out with these guys ! i purchased a mobile detail through living social . tried to schedule it multiple times , but they never answer the phone , and for awhile , the voice mail box was full .
horrible day to eat here today . ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and my bread was molded . my co-worker ordered a chicken salad sandwich and her lettuce was rotting .
tonight at the skyline casino my husband and i were treated extremely unfair . the shift manager connie ( a man ) did not have all the correct facts together and did not want to hear what happened .
went to this restaurant today for lunch . it was the worst experience i have ever had in a restaurant in my life . the staff was completely unorganized and had no idea who was covering what area .
update months have passed & not one person has made an effort even to apologize . worst place & customer service ever . so i came here to get my nails done friday morning with my friend since the place i always go to was packed .
hard to believe that a company can earn an average 1 star rating at each and every yelp registered location unless you have had the misfortune to be one of their customers . then you would n't expect anything more .
really loved this place when old dr keller was there . but since the new vet it has gone down hill . went in for rabies shot than told could not give shot because of teeth . we were told to go to another vet .
wanted to try this place , called at 5 after 8 , the close at 9 . they said it was to late to order , ca n't put together a pizza in 55 mins ?
falafel was just ok. one of cooks dropped his giant rolling pin and then just put it back on his work surface
poor customer service . overpriced items . store is 'open ' late but most of the specialty areas are closed early . so not really open late
sitting here waiting to tan because 10 is down yet again ! last time it was down for 8 weeks and it 's been down for two so far this time . i pay the same amount each month even though 25 of my level of beds are down .
that 's hilarious that you would say you had no untreated termite issues now ! but you did back then 3 months i had them in my shower and your management team did nothing about them !
staff is great until you move in then they do not give a damn about you . everything is falling apart even though they apparently remodeled the place . the walls are super thin you can hear a fly fart .
do n't use this location for a western union money transfer ! they demand the transfer be done with cash . gee , since when did a debit card not equal cash ? there was no mention on the western union website about this location only dealing with cash .
service here is absolutely awful ! expect to sit and wait 20 to 30 minutes just to order your drink . today we waited for 30 minutes to be greeted only to be told that their register was down and they were no longer taking orders for the day .
if they went any slower , i would have grown a man beard . which is difficult seeing how i am a woman . i 'm sitting in the drive through as i write this .
worst service i have ever had with a rental car company . had to speak with a call center representative in mexico & would not be allowed to talk to a supervisor or a manager . reservation made 2 months ago for a family member .
literally was on the table five minutes after ordering . seems positive except the food taste about as good as 5 minute food can taste . simple lemonade taste like flavored water which ranked about the same as for blandness of food . should have gone to buca .
in town for work for couple of months and needed a trim . found this place on yelp and it got great reviews so i made an appointment . i was sooo disappointed . i literally wanted to cry when she was finished .
i got a salad and the vegetables tasted like when you forget to dry your laundry .
this is probably the worst pho restaurant you could go to . the restuarant is usually too busy to serve you . the service is dog trash and so is the food . i do n't think they understand what too much salt is .
2nd time we 've come and they 're closed when they 're supposed to be open ! wth ! came by at noon on a saturday and at 7pm on thursday ! poor advertising . why set out street signage with hours when they 're not open !
please do not use this agency ! they are horrible ! the staff is rude and sean covers and excuses their horrific behavior , i was treated snotty and hung up on . there 's too many good agencies to deal with this type of bad customer service . beware
my husband and i stopped here for dinner . we could n't believe how cheap the prices were , well we ordered two rolls , one for each , chicken fried rice for my husband and spicy teriyaki noodles for me .
i called this place and requested a tow . i was on the phone for 10 minutes while she figured out my quote then took down all my information . she told me it was going to take one hour .
do n't book group meetings here ! this place is usually good and not badly priced , but tonight was just shameful for our group meeting .
ended up here with a family of ten for a sunday lunch because the one next door ( alton tower restaurant ) had a line up . big mistake ! food 4 10 service 0 10 very rude and impatient waitress . oh well .
omg can someone explain what 's so hard to punch information as you given it !
out of town and went here for a haircut based on reviews . the gentleman ( big dude ) that cut my hair did a pretty poor job . not sure if the clippers even cut my hair . not sure what kind of scissors he used .
this was honestly the worst manicure and pedicure of my life .
thanks for nothing a-holes . made a reservation for 3 cabs at 4 pm , no show still 2 hours later . worthless company . do n't waste your time !
in the words of grumpy cat . absolutely awful ! '' i went there the other day because i have n't seen a checkers in years . maybe now i know why . first , the service was good . i did n't have any issues there .
the red velvet pancakes do not make up for the more than half an hour wait for drinks that we had to order three times , the inattentive wait staff nor the cold breakfasts that were delivered to our table !
ate there tonight and did n't care much for it . been here before but this will be it . the sandwich fell apart and was inconvenient to handle . tonight they had the pandora on the tv set to some rap station and the lyrics were highly inappropriate .
the guy never came out for the scheduled estimate . i called for a status and was greeted rudely by the employee .
please do n't make the mistake by using this venue for your wedding , we did . what a huge mistake . they appear to be very accommodating and experienced . .what a major disconnect between staff , , what we were told , and what actually took place .
called in a order for a half and half told the man my wife would be there in 45 minutes to pick it up . my wife gets there the lady tells my wife no order was there .
changed ownership mid year and the new staff is remarkable unimpressive . food is not good and service is horrendous . like this is their first food serving endeavor .
the food was predictable , not bad . the older woman working the counter was as nasty as she could be . no name tag , of course , but i will submit a comment on the corporate website .
this was the worst dining experience i have ever had . the waiters were rude and dismissive , and every dish we ordered was incorrect ( i.e . i ordered a steak medium and it came to the table blue rare ) .
i didnt see this review until it was too late . i had paint dropped on my dining room shade . kevin said he could do the job . i called and left off my shade at his place . he ruined it beyond use .
24.99 for dinner on a friday night and you can only order maximum 5 pieces of sashimi per person for ayce . yet they had the guts to say if you do n't finish the dishes they gon na charge you .
a little dirty place in a bad strip mall . i have been here twice and both times the bouncer guy asked me if i had coke or wanted to buy some . it 's a dump
great salad , pizza was meh . service was so-so during our lunch . but there is nothing quite like an employee stealing your expensive and limited edition sunglasses the minute you leave .
been here twice , both times the owner was rude and insulted our table . they are not accommodating , nor friendly in any way . you are served by children , the decor is cheap and tacky . too bad , we really wanted to like this place .
do n't go .
horrible place . they forgot to call on a cancellation then today i drove my daughter there only to hear that i should have been told her teeth were fine .
if you do n't mind being treated poorly , disrespected , and then mocked shop here ! so disappointing since this is a fairly new store and was highly anticipated to open .
poor customer service . greeted by a rude gentleman who ruined my whole experience . walked out right away with his poor attitude .
this gym is a newer location and it 's clean . it has been busier than usual which sucks . the only thing that is missing is a pool and a sauna which none of the chains have .
i learned of this restaurant from restaurant.com and tried this restaurant for the first time for a romantic dinner .
never again will i buy anything at this store . went there to get a water pipe and somehow left with an expensive vaporizer that was pretty much useless for its intended purpose . burned through a lot of plant material '' without much of an effect .
i absolutely agree with the other yelpers . i ran into multiple issues regarding delivery , product damage and things being out of stock . after you purchase they really are unconcerned about customer service . i will never shop there again .
i 'm there at least once a week . why ? the food and price is the only reason . the food and prices are a match the reason i 'm giving this one star is because of customer service .
small leak in 1 4 '' line . quoted $ 135 ( minimum ) . no thank you ! i fail to see where less than an hour of work and less than $ 10 in parts equates to the quoted price .
super disappointed ! i ordered orange chicken and mongolian beef for lunch here . i get home and to my surprise the chicken is all bread , and has a hard and chewy texture . i 'm not even sure what i was eating was actual chicken .
do not move here ! it will be your biggest regret . the residents and office people are stuck up and anal . there is animal shit everywhere . roaches everywhere . bed bugs everywhere . very expensive place to live but its filthy dirty !
called them to have 2 windows repaired . they scheduled for 12:00 did n't show at that time , said they would arrive until 2:00 , we wait longer . we call , the young girl was very unprofessional and kept making excuses stating that gas was expensive etc ?
usually a great chinese dim sum restaurant . but today , service was bad . food was delayed ( lots of tables waiting for their orders ) . plates were half the portion it is supposed to be . poor customer service and food all around .
i decided to visit the rom with my boyfriend since he 's never been .
this was a waste on my time . i was here for a hour and they closed it down ! there was a couple clouds 10 miles away .
the wait was over 30 minutes and the waiter was next to the worst . even the mgr offer us a free dessert , but then the waiter said it was only for one . smh ! r if i wanted to i could buy this place .
do n't do it . you get what you pay for & i ended up being housekeeping . dirty sheets , hair in the shower , on the toilet and a wad on the kitchen '' floor . not to mention urine on the toilet & floor .
alamo sucks ! when i reserved the car online i was promised a midsize but when i got to the counter i was told that i could get a midsize for $ 88 more . i did n't think i would need a printed copy of my email .
if i could give zero stars i would . hold on to your receipts even on refunds , if not you will be out of your money . i returned a pair of shorts and never got the money back credited to my account .
i 've been here a few times , but my latest visit for lunch was pretty lackluster .
these people run out of baked potato than anyone else i know ! they 're a restaurant . how can you run out of baked potato every time i order it ? theres a harris teeter down the street too .
i 've lived at sunset pointe for over 3 years now . in the beginning , everything was so good . but as of the late , any issue that arises , the staff takes weeks to handle them .
i just do n't know how anyone can feel comfortable attending mass here . new building has so much echo you ca n't understand anything . the altar is so far away you need a telescope to see what 's going on .
can i give it less than one star ? restaurant screws up every time we have ordered . do n't waste your time here , go somewhere else .
tried to eat breakfast today . when i went in , i was not greeted and since it was my first visit , i wandered on in . i walked around several tables back to what seemed to be the main counter .
i highly recommend that you do not consider this place as your home . living there was probably the worst experience i have ever had . the manager desiree does n't enforce their own rules . after just 8 months i had had enough and moved .
this location has no sense of time ! i checked in online and was told a 35 min wait . i get to the location & verify check in & told 20 min . i 'm now at over an hour wait with a ton of excuses .
i was really excited to bring a group of coworkers here for a team building activity . however , it was nearly impossible to speak to anyone or get an email response when trying to coordinate the event .
the food is served cold and even if it is warm it 's awful and over salted . long waits , slow service and food is sub par . servers will come to your table once maybe twice after they take the order . drinks never refilled .
one of the dirtiest , messiest and under stocked grocery stores i 've ever seen , they 're undergoing renovation right now so it 's even worse . can you guys bother to even clean the entrance during the fall ?
i 've been taking my dog here for about a year now because i take her to banfield pet hospital ( great service there by the way ) but lately i am just so disappointed in the grooming salon .
the pics shown are not the hotel you 'd be staying at . when you get to the supposed hotel room , they make you walk about 4 blocks away to a totally different hotel which turns out to be a condo airbnb .
horrible service -- did not even wait for food -- rude order taker did not bring drinks nor wanted to add items to my order . and turned back on 2x me after i went to ask her about ordering and problems w drinks .
wow . .i called them as i am looking to move , but whoever answered surely did n't want the business .
i agree , quite likely the worst subway on the planet . the employees do not care 1 about you , or your order . i 'd rather have a sandwich from the dining hall in all seriousness .
i have been eating at that place for at least 4 years and it used to be good and started to go worse and worse till last week .
i pulled into this car wash today at 5:30 . the website clearly said it closed at 6 p.m. . the weather was fine and it was not dark yet . tell me why this business closed at 5:30 and turned me and at least 4 other customers away .
this was the absolute worst place i have ever stayed .
this store is run by children ! rude ones at that ! went into store to look around . i was at the cabinet at the front . a young man finally came over to assist me . he took a few items out the cabinet for me .
just came through the drive thru to pick up some lunch and was informed that they do n't have hard taco shells or soft taco shells . really ? what 's left ? why are you even open ?
the worst taco bell in toronto ive ever been to . i am so glad to be the first person to give them a review . in 2010 i ordered 2 soft beef tacos from them .
do n't wast your time or money ! this is ridiculous . the inside was hardly even cleaned ! i ca n't stand lazy businesses . ugh !
i hate vape land . these guys have single-handedly messed up every atomizer that i bring in this store . i honestly think i would have more success doing the build myself .
not a good experience . went on a wednesday night for a five year old 's birthday . no music , no show , no appearance by chuck e cheese from 6 - 8pm . children dissapointed .
the discount offered on groupon is not worth the damage she does . she is incredibly unprofessional and i have the scars to prove it .
brought our dog here and by the time we got home it was obvious they 'd gotten shampoo ( or something in his eyes ) , called to inquire and they were rude and unhelpful
fuck . oh gosh where do i start ? the customer service it the worst here . everytime i need to walk into the office to talk to one of the ladies . they take forever . you 'll be waiting there for at least 30 minutes .
they charge unreasonably for every little thing and try to rope you in for more charges . everything had a convenience fee '' or surcharge '' and ridiculous taxes that add up to a lot .
disgusting ! if it were possible to give this location a negative star rating , i would ! avoid at all costs !
go for the tea , leave without eating anything . good tea if you 're into that kind of thing . the food , horrid . bland , tasteless , processed & microwaved . yuck .
omg did you just sell me a day old cookie ? disappointed ! we were walking by and smelled what we thought were going to be delicious cookies .
this place really sucks i went in there to rent equipment and the staff acted like they didnt want to help anyone out . i mean i know working sucks , but come on it 's your job .
i will never visit burger king again . just drove thru this location 's drive thru . the woman was so rude to us in the drive thru . my nine year old daughter even noticed . the burger was cold , too . 2nd time at this location .
i took my daughter n law and grandpa 's to get pesos today . the girls who did my daughter and grandpa 's were fantastic . especially with a 3 year old who was extremely sleepy . i am giving a pour review because of a couple of reasons .
when i heard champaign was getting a waterpark , i was ecstatic ! until i visited the place , and realized it is more like a kiddie pool than anything else. they spent so much money on another kiddie pool ?
brought colleagues for some business discussions to wynn . we moved chairs to ensure we could sit in a circle and hear each other : three different employees interrupted us to demand we move the chairs back . total , the chairs moved a few feet . very bizarre .
i decided to visit this location as i was already headed to whole foods . i should have stuck with my local store where most the girls know me and are helpful . i was returning 3 bottles of product two of them had exploded .
if i could give 0 stars i would . i 'm absolutely disgusted with this company . my family and i will never shop here again . i went in the store to paid my credit card off , in cash , and it never posted .
do n't get oil changed here . made an appointment 3 days in advanced to where i was told if i wait it would be 30-45 min .
horrible experience . i will never rent from this company again . after paying my last rent i got a collection notice ! nobody was helpful when i called to ask wtf had happened . bunch of incompetent people .
this gym is horrible ! i told them initially i only wanted the membership for a month .
a few co-workers and i showed up at around 11:10 for lunch . we waited till 11:20 and they were still closed . very unprofessional . we had to run through the drive-thru to make it back to work on time .
worst experience ever ! lady walked into my fitting room without knocking and accused me of taking photos of the dress . ( i was half naked when she came in ) note : there were no mirrors inside the fitting room .
i went here on a sunday afternoon and i thought i landed in the twilight zone . it took me over 30 minutes to check out and i was the next person in line . the person checking me out was not hospitable .
sadly , i 've had better pizza at get go and the cheese stix looked like the driver stopped at the 7 11 on the way . $ 40 in the trash .
these people are liars and cheats . do not do business with them . the sales people tell you one thing ( like the fact that they 're not brokers ) and it 's complete lies .
went here to pick up and online sears order . waited 25 minutes at the service desk . there were no check-out lanes open . never was waited on while the service desk person took customers out of order .
i stopped in to grab a quick , healthy lunch . their salad bar ( at 12:30 in the afternoon ) was wilted and brown .
i can not express how upset i am with the job they did on my dog . poor guy has cuts all over him . do not go here if you do n't want your dog in pain .
this place possesses as atmosphere of only old people they are biased of younger crowds : ( sucks because the girls there are nice
i gave this place one star because i could n't give it zero stars . i was told i could just d a walk in and would be seen for my x-rays . 1 1 2 hours later the receptionist said it would be 20 minutes .
i have been coming to this place on a regular basis for years . the last time i was there i was disappointed by the lack of service . i was there with my family on the weekend and asked for extra plates .
worst customer service experience ever . wanted green curry chicken $ 10.25 but it only came with 3 types of veggies , two which i wanted to replace with two other types . with his strange logic , waiter said $ 2 extra to replace the veggies ?
i really do n't need to write this review because i agree with the other reviews 100 . but i will . the food was pretty much disgusting . the service was awful . the smell ? awful !
went last night with my wife and for starters they ran out of there signature beer . i should have new something was up when i heard the server tell the table next to our that they were closing .
this subway needs to get its act together . i have been there 3 times this summer and there have been different staff each time and none of them knew what they were doing .
waited sitting for 20min without being served until i decided to stand up and leave . they are either disrespectful or disorganized to let people wait that long .
when i questioned the owners about his bill he went ballistic shouting and said i now only accept cash now . do your due diligence i did not and paid for it . big time overcharged for a basic repair .
i went once and was n't impressed . i tried it again and it did n't fare any better .
please , please do not use these movers . this company does not deserve any stars . they should be put out of business .
let me start by saying i love a good buffet , this is not a good buffet . my first impression was poor , dated and frayed carpeting , torn fabric on booths , but you pay as soon as you get in so i stayed .
i would have liked to give a good review but ca n't because after driving 20+ minutes from home to try this place out at 1 pm it was closed , with a note on the door saying open at 3pm .
horrible customer service , i have been to this location on several occasions and my coffee is never made right . very disappointing because the location is perfect but i would definitely go elsewhere with my money .
apparently the remodel did not improve the customer service .
went in to get sandwiches with my two kids today and the lady making my sandwich dropped the f-bomb twice while complaining about how long her night out was and how she could n't wait to get off work .
if you get tickets for free , i guess it is better than gambling and losing money , but i could n't wait for it to end !
be very careful when deciding to seek medical help here . i went to this location on a sunday as other places may not be open sundays . i saw a physicians ' assistant for about 10 minutes to learn that i had a sinus infection .
bad . shockingly expensive , poor quality food . the salad bar is a nice idea , however it has no lights - how are you supposed to make a salad in the dark ? the inside seating area was dirty and felt like a denny 's in disguise .
super quick , super expensive , and not good at all- almost a sad at-home attempt to create your own chipotle burrito . salsas in little cups tasted weird . save your money !
sometimes ease of access is a bad thing . i 've lived near this location for a year . i come here for one stop shopping . i will come by once a month and ask myself why i had n't been in so long .
worst . service . ever ! 3 tables walked out in our 1.5 hours we were there .
very bad experience . there was n't much of a buffet . the place was 80 degrees and top it off there were 5 buses of tourists .
nasty bar with awful service ! i 've never been so disrespected by a bartender before ! not only was i harassed 2 seconds after walking in the bar by a bartender with purple hair , but she also stared at myself & my girlfriends the entire time .
this is what you get for a large $ 15 oxtail and bad service is complimentary . the women that work there need an attitude adjustment . dare i say racist ? just observe their behavior with their own people '' versus outsiders '' that frequent this restaurant .
i stopped for lunch since i enjoy asian food . first the person taking my order was extremely short and seemed like i was bothering him if i asked him a question .
nothing in this place is particularly impressive . we 've all had cheese and bread before . its popular among people who know little else around the area . the service is usually bad because they seem to think they are local legends .
just heard this guy was arrested for stealing people 's money . do not hire him for anything !
i do n't usually do these but the owner just rubbed me the wrong way . i walked in 5 minutes early his door was open and he said , hopefully you are not here for food the only place open is the sushi place . ''
i 've tried to give this gas station a chance three times . their receipt machines never work . do n't go here if you have to save receipts .
this is the worst food , and it 's gotten worse since their value menu .
american home shield tried to get me to use these guys , but after reviewing their horrible record on the state of nevada contractors board ( violations up the ying yang ) , i said no thank you and requested a different company .
this place is super busy . it 's quite a shame me being korean and all . i 'm quite convinced that the owner of this establishment limits their staff for how many refills of side dishes can be served .
first and last time with payless .
my family has been going to sante fe for over 20 years . we remember when this cafe was really great , but 5 years ago , we had the slowest service ever and quit going after the movies .
i would n't sign up at this facility . it 's currently 66 degrees outside and 86 degrees inside this club .
rude , 20 minutes time limit , security kicks you out without letting you finish your meal , even with 70 seats empty . stay away if you want a peaceful meal .
what an on going night mare constantly not keeping their dead lines , now wanting to charge more for work already started , zero communication , dishonest .and not even finishing work started . constant delays , and shotty work on top
my husband ordered roses for our anniversary . after three days , they are wilted . i called they wanted the old bouquet , and did replace it with another . the roses had no filler of any kind , and again , we 're wilted after three days .
this company does n't even deserve 1 star . their dispatchers are rude & stupid . the tow drivers are n't much better . i 've had the displeasure of doing business with them twice . avoid this company at all cost .
i am astounded at all the positive reviews . this place was nasty and overpriced . yeah , the manager came by with a free , gimmicky , baby cookie , but that does n't make up for the horrid food .
we walked in and the lady that took our order had a bit of an attitude so it was n't off to a good start . but we ordered a medium cheese pizza and was told it would only take about 15 minutes .
had the signature burger . it literally was like eating a pile of salt . i could n't even down my first bite . the fries were good and shakes were too . the service was awesome but i 'll stick to the ones in the midwest .
i ended up here because of a coupon with misleading wording . the food was simply disgusting and way too expensive . service was untrained and way too amateurish .
i believe this place has closed . every time we stop by they are not open despite the posted hours on the door .
rude and sloppy . about three months ago i decided i would stop coming here after being cut on two different occasions by manicurists while they trimmed my cuticles .
usually i really like this place and go often but i had a rotten experience here last night that has ruined my opinion of this place forever . i went with a friend at night and ordered drinks .
very slow delivery . not recommend it . you can buy more good things from ebay .
give me a break caesars palace , to charge almost $ 30 for a captain n coke and a vodka club soda ? screw you . that is offensive . we would have stayed and bought multiple rounds before the show started but instead we left .
avoid this dump ! if u dont mind partying with 45 50 yr olds , then this is the place for you .
the current ads for mayo clinic as caring , concerned amazing cancer facility could not be further from the truth . i had skin cancer - diagnosed and operated on by physicians at mayo .
technician was nice , but we were over charged for service . later discovered we were charged $ 219 for a $ 30 part . and labor was added that should have been part of the hour service call charge .
scam ! received a fraudulent invoice for $ 70 . never heard of this company . have never used them . .of course due to this scam never will !
for being a member of diamond resorts and have stayed here in the past , i have never received such terrible service from this hotel . they may have the cool amenities '' but their service has just gone straight down the drain .
fair at best . frozen margaritas were good . staff was friendly enough . guacamole was n't good . salsa was n't good . chips were okay . need i say more ?
i have to preface this by saying the experience was with takeout , not sit down and perhaps the issues were due to that .
small portions for exorbitant prices . ordered the surf and turf - lobster was a normal tail , as expected , but the steak on the side was completely disappointing . 5 measly pieces of cut up steak that were n't even tender or tasty .
my wife and i are traveling to se asia and someone we know recommended this place . after having the consultation we found the pricing was almost $ 600 for a few simple vaccines .
worst apartment complex i ever lived in ! the staff is rude and never helpful . my car was marked to be towed several times because i left it in the same parking spot for more than one day with a parking pass .
do n't send reminders about appointments , being a busy mum you can forget .
i 'm leaving one star because that 's the minimum i can leave . kfc at this location has lost my business .
awful place . manager is money hungry and receptionists are rude . i feel like the service department is shady too . go somewhere else people . deep regrets going here . i like to be valued when i choose to spend my money .
the drivers are complete jerks . .they try and run you off the road ! do n't do business with these inconsiderate people !
seriously such a crappy place . they gave me wrong information , the one guy was stoned and right at 730 just was over helping me because it was his time to go .
walked out due to tech yelling at young girl that could n't explain what she was looking for .
i went to this np after seeing positive yelp reviews . i went for my annual well woman visit , which should have been entirely covered . my insurance billed me $ 150 for tests they required me to do .
one customer order ahead of me , i ordered 4 tacos , and waited for almost 20 minutes .
i booked a room on their website and it said the room was already reserved so i was n't able to get the room . come to find out they charged my card anyway . apparently a reservation was still made despite what the website said .
awful service , slow , biscuit was under cooked . had we drove off when the window gave us our food , we would have not had our drinks , spoons , or straws .
are you kidding me ? sunday morning , nine a.m. and you guys are selling stale donuts ?
unbelievable ! 2:00 in the afternoon , walk in to entrance , not a single shopping cart in site . oh well , walk around the store for 15 minutes , back to the entrance . about 10 carts !
everyone knows your name kinda bar . .in all the bad ways . i 'm surprised places like this get by at all . is it the neighborhood ?
thinking i would play it safe my first time here , i ordered the asian steak salad . you ca n't ruin salad , right ? bleh ! the steak was a cheap cut that was chewy and fatty .
the manager lied to me about the vat , and would not provide the form . she said she does not charge the tax ( however , it is already built into the price ) .
very slow service and food did not taste fresh but the biggest complaint is the large '' fry 's . when i got home the fries looked like someone ate a couple handfuls already . pictures are being posted . really ?
it 's mothers day and they did n't want to assist me because i would be using their $ 20 for $ 40 flower arrangement certificate . they said to use it on another day , i was very disappointed . spent my $ 60 elsewhere .
glenn is right . unless we were there on the very same bad night , '' this restaurant might have more than one . glenn did forget to mention how dark and gross the place is .
and yet another closure . why are my go-to places losing the battle ? i will miss your patio and cheap , cheap appetizers . though you were n't all that , and not even the chips , you were always accessible and affordable . cheers to you .
just horrible . go to the local chinese food places . long wait , disrespectful employees , and bad food ! not worth a penny ! panda express should seriously reconsider how they decide who is hired and who is not !
incompetent . this panda express does not know how to manage their product . waiting in line for one meal however they ran out of a particular item , ok wait is only two minutes to make , meanwhile the second item requested is available .
do n't buy macaroons before closing . sales associate was n't that helpful and was giving us a hard time ? wo n't be back no matter how good this bakery is .
i wanted to like this place , as it is close by . unfortunately when the manager has done my nails they are lifting at the cuticle within one day . i explained it to her and she said i do n't know what i 'm talking about .
a number of years ago i got really severe food poisoning from a whopper i had here . i was off work vomiting and with the runs for 3 days . i have n't been back and do not intend to go there .
went in to close our business and checking accounts , we did n't need them we decided to stay with our original bank . after being asked 100 and 1 questions the branch manager finally went thru on closing the accounts .
i took my kia optima in for service and was assisted by oscar .
first time ordering from this location and very disappointed . when i placed the order online , i was quoted 30-40 minutes , order showed up 5 mins shy of an hour . by the time it was delivered , pizza and cheese sticks were cold .
i ordered a turkey leg with mac and cheese and green beans . they messed up the order and gave me potato salad instead of mac and cheese - which tasted sour and overall inedible . the green beans were overpowered by seasoning and equally unappetizing .
i bought a coupon on living social and i had the hardest time just obtaining an order conformation . after a month ( literally 30 days ) of calling , sending over 5 emails , and placing orders on the company 's website , no response from the bakery .
horrible . do not go . the staff doesnt pay attention to your orders or care at all . all the food is watery & lacking real flavor . even the salsa is pretty crappy . i 'd rather eat my own fingernails !
thr staff was really rude when we asked for a reschedule . so rude that my 8 yr old refused to back to the swimming class . and they still kept charging my credit card for 2 months . when i asked for refund they refused .
customer service is horrible . did not know this places closed at 9:30 . i showed up a little before 9 , and apparently you can not order from a menu .
i never write a review but this place earned it so this is a write up on there boba smoothies as for a boba standard smoothies these where awful the boba was not cooked correctly which counts for 70 percent of a good quality boba .
i was really bored during the show . yes , they are very talented and i saw some great dives , etc . but overall it was not what i expected .
deli food in a viewing case , upset i did n't take a picture because it would enforce what i 'm about to comment . wow .
okay , so this place is a big deal up here . it 's the equivalent of dunkin donuts in boston . you 'll find a tim hortons on almost every block here . i tried it for the first time today . i 'm not impressed .
i 've been to other chilis restaurants in the us and have never had such a poor experience . although the food was good , our waitress was always missing . we could not find her .
i went to bjs and requested a basic car wash and oil change .
zero stars is not an option . you feel like your headed somewhere special with the drais backdrop when you arrive . you 're led down an attractive hall and elevator . then once in you realize that unless you paid for bottle service you can not sit down .
awful , even the manager does not have customer service skills . i will never go back there . i ca n't tell you how bad this location is . not clean , not friendly employees , . i could keep typing , but i wont , for now .
do not treat at woodson . you will regret it . if you even see a dr you should expect 5 minutes of their time and a bill of $ 250 .
3 different answers from on line airport kiosk then the counter . final result was we left things behind to meet their baggage criteria and ended up paying even more at the airport .
stay away from this dealership i beg you ! i brought my car in to have window motor and door lock fixed after it was stuck down driving in from los angeles .
i brought my car in to auto crafters when my ac started blowing hot air . they ended up sticking me with a $ 85 charge .
just waited 30 minutes in the drive through . no kidding ! we were stuck and there was nothing we could do . horrible experience . on top of all that i paid $ 27 for two large sandwiches and a cinnabon ! crazy !
wanted to deposit money from another bank and was advised to walk to drive threw atm on foot and look out for cars because they cant pull money from a visa card inside the actual building lol ! no longer banking here .
first and last time i 'll do business with them . the pizza i ordered was barely warm , but i was hungry so i threw a few slices in the microwave .
i shall never , and i mean , never ride the mega bus again . my trip from clt to dc was just horrible . way too many stops for me ; 20 minute break , raleigh durham , and richmond .
run as fast as you can from this company . our ac went out 2 years ago . our home warranty company sent out these people . after waiting 3 weeks ( in july ! ) , we finally had our ac installed .
worst haircut ever ! all choppy , you can see where he cut with scissor marks in lines and was uneven everywhere. supercuts or beauty school would be a better choice. ''
worst mcdonalds ever ! 90 of the time they get your order wrong and sometimes at night they only accept cash . this place is poorly ran by a very rude manager who ca n't even get an order right when he takes it .
if i could , i would give this place no stars . to start off i have been taking my grandmother there for the past couple weeks , and every time we go it is just the worst customer service i 've ever had in my life !
usually love the light rail system , but tonight was ridiculous . i checked both online and their mobile app to ensure they ran until 2am , which both listed they ran well past .
i ordered the chicken balls , should 've gone to mcdonald 's right next to it . because the chicken balls '' which the server did n't add sweet and sour sauce to . the whole line felt very rushed .
an auto repair nightmare . they repaired the air conditioning on my truck which was blowing hot air . i pick up the vehicle and paid for the repairs and by the time i got home it was blowing hot air again .
got the garlic and manchurian chicken , there was very little taste difference it all tasted the same . the portions were smaller . i got robbed from this place as well someone pick pocketed my 20 the staff did not assist me .
this place sucks . they put out shit that is n't available to buy . why put it out there if you ca n't buy it ? also , believe that is a violation .
rmt was ok . i needed to reschedule and the receptionist amanda was very rude . i was quite disappointed and will be looking elsewhere .
this store is the worst for any formal flower arrangement . went there to get a prom corsage .
went to get a simple smog check and they ripped me off for a brake fluid flush that they clearly did not even perform .
i had dinner last night at eddie 's house . two out of the 5 of us took the waiters recommendation and ordered what 's in the steak '' . it is suppose to have garlic mixed in the potatoes and both of us tasted horseradish . totally disgusting !
i have been using this location for a few years now , and gradually the customer service has been getting worse and worse . i have finally reached my breaking point in the past few months .
ordered a pizza online around 10:30pm tonight , paid for the order and waited a few minutes . my girlfriend and i received a call that they do not deliver to our part of town ( s nellis blvd and vegas valley ) after dark .
i read the reviews below , and they are dead on !
i took my daughter here today and our experience here was terrible . there is a very noticeable lack of professionalism . payment was required upfront before being seen . never experienced that before .
review based on service hours . they have great juices , however , i 've been to this location on two separate occasions to get juice in the morning before i started my day and they were not open when they should have been .
if you are not black , be careful when dealing with employees in this lowes . the management '' of this store is o.k . with black rage '' . you will not be happy dealing with that unless your are , in fact , black .
visited here with my husband for a date night . food was bland and typical , also small in portion size . service was slow , however i should note that there was only one waitress taking care of tables .
if you 're looking for a great greek salad , this is n't the place for you . the lettuce tasted fine i guess , but that was pretty much the whole salad .
this airline is absolutely the worst ! super crammed seating , the fees i read about but were written to make me believe i could n't have any carry on items without paying $ 45 ahead of time otherwise i would get charged $ 100 at the gate .
us airways is , by far , the worst airline i have ever encountered .
major disappointment . burrito the size of a rolled taco . tostada with about a tablespoon of beans on half the tostada .
i am 55 years old . i tried to purchase wine and they refused to sell it to me without showing my id . i left .
never on time . i typically wait an hour to be seen . the dr never tells me their name or apologizes for the wait . the office seems dingy and the rooms are tiny . i 'm not a big fan of this place .
very slow service ! no sign in sheet ( meaning nobody knows who 's next ) long wait times ! will not recommended or shop here anymore !
not to happy with these hotels , they want to charge for everything , including certain areas of the pool . do n't come in june seems to be college students and young adults . annoyed with pool area they do n't have enough recliners for the guests .
this is a pretty concept but a weak execution . everything we had was bland . the prices were also ridiculous for what you get . skip this gimmick and get some seafood from a real restaurant not a kiosk .
went again today and actually had to leave without eating or so much as receiving coffee ! this place and i just do not agree .
terrible , rude , dead fairway , solid sand traps , overcrowded , bad food , and tacky . a reasonable price but still not worth the money . there are plenty of other places to golf .
this was the worst mexican food ever , they do n't know any better ! i suggest to take a trip anywhere to u.s. to learn what good mexican food looks like . i do n't recommend it at all !
worst indian food ever . when you write a bad review , they 'll petition yelp to remove it . so it 's so bad here , i 'm writing again . the tandoori chicken is not authentic tandoori .
absolutely terrible , tried a bison '' entree only to experience food poisoning within an hour after completing my meal , whether or not it 's 100 bison , is definitely questionable .
would have been nice to have a drink after an 8 hour shift tonight . instead i wasted my time going to cogburns . i arrived at about 12:30am , music was still going strong and there was a little crowd in the bar area .
this is the worst store in charlotte . the employees are arrogant jerks . take your business elsewhere . the employees will treat you as if your beneath them
we thought the restaurant served unremarkable food . the fried eggs were overcooked . the toast and coffee were mediocre . we liked our very nice waitress . my husband and i both agreed that we would n't return despite the low cost of the meal .
what a horrible company to do business with . every year we have to spend an hour with their customer service department on billing issues . we 've had a pitney bowes postal meter for years .
food : horrible , tasted like everything was microwaved and none of the staff knew english . service : horrible not much else to say about here . definitely would n't go here again .
stepped into this place and i get the immediate feeling that they did not want to serve us . took our order , never asked if we wanted to go or not , the person taking the orders did not even bother to ask for my name .
if you feel like paying $ 35 for a horrible margarita and some soggy nachos , this is your spot ! i 've come in here twice now because the lure of a margarita is too much to fight but i 've left disappointed every time .
this is my second bad experience here . i vowed never to return . should have stuck to it . recently revisited this location . my order ( by phone ) : large pepperoni , single dipping sauce .
if i owned this place id be fuming . money walks out the door routinely based on terrible service . incredibly slow to begin with so i ordered online . twice now in the last couple weeks its been an issue and i left without food .
not recommended . i wish apartment complexes would understand that just because your property is nice does n't mean that the people in the office or management are easy to work with and actually make you hate living where you do .
i would be more than happy to rate this company 's work , however , if they did n't even show up to provide me with an estimate , as promised , that would be difficult .
the customer service and the cancellation process at planet fitness is terrible . i asked the staff to process a cancellation and they told me i need to speak with the general manager . i left two messages within a week for the general manager and both were unreturned .
i give them one star for being open . other than that . service was horrible , they ran out of the pasta for the dish ordered and a roach measuring almost three inches ran across my friends foot then up the wall behind the wine bottles .
worst sushi i 've ever had ! the rolls are never fresh , they have obviously been sitting in the refrigerator for about 2 days . and their deep fried rolls are even cold !
horrible customer service , did n't take time on nails , i got my gel nails and toes done less then a week ago and already chipping . they did n't leave the gel on long enough in the heater so it 's discolored .
i use to work here and all i can say is this is a horrible place to work at and eat at . the managers always fighting with other workers bad communication and they do n't work as a team .
total ripoff . the workers there are very loud and rude . they over-charge you with a fast , shitty and effortless job . been there 4x and never again . cheap quality and services
this company is a disgrace and their customer service is horrendous . stay as far away as you can . my solar system had to be completely redone because of their incompetence ( by a company that actually knew what they were doing ) .
this place used to be good but i think maybe they have new cooks . still it 's ok as buffets go . my issue is that when it 's time to pay you need to be sure to watch your bill .
i did take out for a large plain pizza , which came to a total of $ 30 dollars . the quality and the taste of the pizza are mediocre at best , with nothing to show for the extremely high price tag .
my sister went to get her nails done 4 days later they fell off . they were over priced and so mean to her . we went back to get them fix and the owner told us to go to hell and called us crazy .
find anywhere else to go ! the doctor did n't even look at my xrays before he stepped in the room or glanced at my medical records . then i 'm still waiting three weeks later for the doctor to put in the order for an mri .
my doctor had just retired and i had little choice but to visit a doc in a box '' for an infected toe and this was close to work . there was n't even a doctor on the premises in the middle of the afternoon on a week day .
i do not feel safe going here anymore . this is not a good representation of what the lgbtq community is all about .
it 's a rule of thumb , when you serve ramen , it must be piping hot . so in terms of of this , cat noodle failed . my noodles were cold and clumpy and lacked of taste . service was slow and not senior citizen friendly .
disappointed , took a little girl to the craft activity on 06 27 .
the male barista was incredibly rude and threatening to me when i dared to wait for a friend on the outside chairs before i ordered anything . i 've never had anyone in any business speak to me so aggressively .
buffet was lousy could n't talk to anyone who worked there nobody spoke english kids running around nobody saying anything to them there are plenty of buffets in vegas do n't waist your money at texas station buffet
worst service around . first off the gave us a chevy full size the thing was trashed . the backseat had all kinds of trash in it bugs all over the front end the truck have n't been washed in months .
this is one of the worst places i 've been to in the city . we ordered the crab bruschetta as a starter , which tasted like canned tuna on dried toast . it stuck in our throats it was so dry , and completely lacked seasoning .
went to have dinner there , got charged 50 $ and then a separate 39 $ when i had only done one of those charges . security kicked my out of a booth to let their friends sit there even though i was having a meal and drinks .
the three times i tried to go there , one attempt was successful . the first they booked an appointment and when i got there had me on a different day and time i know i did n't book because i was working that day .
i went in for a root canal the dentist said he has been doing it for more than 30 years and felt more than confident to do the procedure . i said okay i felt comfortable .
walked in at 5:05 pm on saturday and told they close at 5:00 . really ? we were told at panini 's that they are not supposed to close . the staff at panini 's was a delight !
food is ok , ribs are amazing , but they forget stuff constantly . and heaven forbid you try and call and let them know .
for a modern '' vietnamese restaurant , i expected higher quality of meat . my meatballs were sour and tasted weird . i feel sick after eating there . would not recommended .
disappointed by this salon . i just experienced a very bad blow dry by a different stylist than i usually go to . it was a recommendation from the receptionist .
staff often as attentive as possible . place often too loud . as a paying customer was asked to leave after only one drink because someone i knew quit working there that night . obviously not interested in a quiet patron . no reason to return .
mediocre to say the least , food was reheated in microwave tasted old was overpriced and the one lady could n't or should n't answer phones and take orders in person . incredibly disappointed they should n't say this is colombian food !
funugyz used to be the happening place . the service is the worst ! my friends and i are regulars here and i swear the service gets worse each week . if it were n't for trivia and supporting shea , i 'd never go back !
really use to love his place and we use to go in atleast once a week and never had shitty service till the last few times and that 's why we stop coming in .
bought a living social deal and after months of calling someone finally returned my call and scheduled an appointment . they were a no show for the appointment . called and left several messages and it always goes to voicemail .
i sat there for 10 min and nothing from the staff . all 5 behind the counter . i finally asked for a menu and what type of non alcoholic beer they had .
worst customer service experience ever ! rude and uptight sales people . i refuse to even go in there .
service was very bad . i was very excepting and patient and did n't complain even though i should 've . the waiter came to take our drink order and i ordered a lemonade and did not receive it at all but then was charged for it .
while mcd 's is n't ever a particularly satisfying experience , this is the worst mcdonalds on earth , probably . i 've had many unpleasant experiences at this mcdonald 's .
gross . the absolute only thing i liked about this place was the very polite delivery guy .
we like saga and normally have a good experience . we tried the robinson location and were surprised with very slow service and poor food quality .
wish i could give 0 stars . the employees are rude , loud and ghetto . the good is always cold . after ordering car side and waiting in my car for 15 minutes i have to go in and wait some more . the food is never right .
would not recommend . my nails are messy and just not done by a skilled person to the standards i am accustomed . i thoroughly expect that the acrylics will lift quickly and will need to be redone in less than a week .
bad service , bad pizza . served to us so hot we could n't even eat it . then it cooled down to a greasy mess . go to little caesars if you want $ 5 pizza instead .
maybe las vegas does n't have sandwiches ? because i ca n't understand why this place has so many 5 star reviews . i ate here based on the reviews , and man was i disappointed ! i got the club and my husband had the reuben .
terrible service . waited forever for a rude server . ended up leaving . not worth the stop .
i came here on a saturday night . the hours of operation are fantastic ! hookah s are reasonably priced as well as bottle service .
our waitress was terrible . she never came to check on us after we received our food . she bounced in to refill our drinks with no ice and never asked about the food .
do not use these people ! they are scam artists ! lied about everything that happened and told us a price that is more than the sign . then told us even more at the shop and would only take cash .
this salon has sadly gone downhill since it opened . i was very impressed the first couple of times i went the service was great , and they did a fantastic job . but somewhere in the last year the customer service has gone downhill .
every single time i 've gone here the service has been horrible . the food and drink is regular chain cafe fare , so if you do n't care about service there 's nothing wrong with this place .
do i know what the food tastes like ? no ! do i know if the drinks are strong ? no ! do i know if the wait staff is friendly ? no ! why ?
job was promised completion in one day . took over a week . constant no shows and excuses . salesman promised it would be done to my satisfaction . not . poor communication between salesman and installers . owner was very combative when i voiced my frustrations .
one star for open 24 7 . bad food , tried a few times and gave chances on different dishes but everything tasted worse than denny 's . very slow even when there were only 5 tables .
first off i want to say i never write reviews but i feel like the customer service i have received twice in the past month was so rude that i needed to speak on it .
this place has the absolute worst customer service . the rude lady at the front needs to be fired . i will never enter their store again .
i went for dinner last night and the food was old , cold , soggy and bland . the hot and sour soup was ok , but everything else should have been tossed out .
we stayed here for a convention and i got food poisoning from the breakfast ( i had eggs , sausage and fruit salad ) . the first room we were in smelled strongly of mildew so we changed rooms .
nasty ! american chinese food with 6 poor choices . the rest , hotdogs , fries , potatoes , spagetti , macaroni and cheese etc the toilets were absolutely filthy . urine all over the floor and black mold growing in the urinals !
this place is terrible . typical terrible french canadian attitude one sees in the movies . valet us not attentive . the bar manager rude . the bed is tiny in an expensive suite . bad experience within 30 mins of checking in .
the pizza i ordered from bennett 's was a horrible , disgusting mess . the cheese was sliding off , and it was ridiculously soggy . when i called to complain , the manager first asked me if i picked it up late .
you will wait at least an hour to get called ( with an appointment ! ! )
our wine glasses came out still wet with lipstick marks on both glasses . we sent them back and the server obviously just wiped them off because you could still see the smudge on both glasses .
this place did have good food for a mexican subway '' style resturant at one time . however they must be feeling some kind of money crunch because the prices keep going up , the extras keep costing more , and the size of the portions keep getting smaller .
$ 8 for a burger and it was microwaved ! - seriously bun and lettuce hot - 1 2 the cheese stuck to the paper . dave is rolling in his grave : (
to bad i have to give any stars . should had known when speaker was broken . the all day menudo for saturday and sunday was not served in the evening . strike two .
we thought we would try them through a groupon promotion . the guy that came out to clean was lucky if he was working on our pool for no more than 5 minutes .
my black bean soup had a small stone in it . fortunately i caught it before destroying a tooth . my wife 's sandwich had a whole sheet of deli paper inside the turkey , layered right into that sandwich . for pete 's sake .
worst experience in a cigar bar ever ! this is my first ever 1 star rating on yelp . i always support local businesses and am never quick to complain about bad service . but wow. this was bad . came in. sat down. no acknowledgment .
food : yuck ! the is worst indian food i have ever had . tasteless , watery and full of oil . i ended up with a stomach ache and in the washroom soon afterwards . location : the location is bright and colourful . no complaints .
these people are clearly rating themselves . stay away . ordered 4 egg & cheese on tasted bagel sandwiches . one minute later they 're brought to our table . sounds good right ? except it takes longer than one minute to cook eggs and toast bagels .
very slow service , even though the place was not busy . i expect average food when i go ihop , but when average food is served cold , it is below average . and we waited a long time for it .
i would give them zero star . very rude employees and refused to exchange the defective earphones . be aware do n't buy from them electric things since they are defected . very rude especially their supervisor .
my boyfriend and i went there for dinner last night . he had the bbq chicken and i had the steak . mt boyfriend has been sick since about an hour when we left the restaurant .
whoever cooks the food during the early am shift is in dire need of professional development ! i ate here at around 4:30am after an epic night on the vegas strip . famished beyond belief and very dehydrated , we arrived ready to eat !
unfortunately the anti pasta salad for two at $ 13 was totally not worth the money . never had we had so little meat and cheese . contacted waitress right away to no avail . even the owner , keith , would not come out to talk with us .
this place sucks . .food , mediocre at best , bland and uninteresting . service . .horrible .
they said my ford ranger truck ranger alternator was bad and they replaced with a rebuilt and charged me a lot of money but promised me a lifetime warranty .
would not recommend ! the woman making the crepes was touching the batter with her bare hands , as well as turning and folding the crepes with her hands .
the ordering process was cool . but they butchered my sandwich . my husband ordered before me and got what he wanted . my order had what my husband ordered on it . certain dressings make me sick and they included those . did not add what i ordered .
i will never attempt to flag or call a badger cab for a ride again . i will only call union cab .
when we saw this place we thought it was a hidden gem , an authentic tasca '' , given the reviews . i do n't understand how anyone can give this a five : poor quality of ingredients , overpriced and badly prepared food , and pretty rude service .
any company that gives you only 4 days to try their product run , i should have known better , system malfunctions within 7 days and no one in the company wants to help . all they do is blame you .
with a $ 13.99 price point , it is hard to resist , but you must ! the sushi is jam packed with rice with barely any filling topping .
i did n't even want to give then on star . unfriendly and unprofessional from the receptionist to the doctor to the sales staff across the way who sells glasses . never again !
went to send out a package and had to deal with a very rude employee . she did n't even want to be there . do n't waste your time just go next door to fedex .
horrible food , horrible service . trash can is over flowing . this is absolutely disgusting ! on the positive note , the tortilla was pretty good .
came again to update my wardrobe and this time it felt worse than the first time . again , hard to match clearance colors by separate pieces and grey 's anatomy brand we 're over priced .
the food was terrible . i would be ashamed to have my name on it . some of the reviews on here complained about service but ours was at least good . food was bland and had little flavor .
i love ross and have been an avid shopper there for many years . i was excited to go to this store , because i have been trying to get christmas presents for my family and friends .
i usually order online and today i had a problem with my pizza . i called the main pizza hut line and was told to contact the store directly . i called several times and it took 30 minutes just to get through .
worst ac company ever ! do yourself a favor and do not call these crooks . paid almost $ 4000 for an ac and a year later it starts making a noise everytime it turned on .
sports bar wan na be . food was cold and so so flavor . had the hail mary burrito which was nothing special , just ground taco meat and the usual veggies wrapped up in a flour shell . waiter did n't seem to interested .
there are two people checking in 100 plus people . the process is ten min or more for check in each party .
it has been some time since i used my groupon at modalities 8 but i see from the reviews that nothing has changed . standing in a hallway to wait for your massage ? really ?
i booked a room , and walked in on another guest . the front desk was unable , for 50 minutes , to answer my question if there was another non smoking room with a desk available .
this place may just seem cute , but it is anything but . the puppies are very cute but almost every single one of them are sick . who in there right mind would sell a sick dog ?
i went there once about 10am , sat down waited for 15 minutes , no one came , i left . i forgot to mention , i was the only customer there .
horrible ! i love el pollo loco but this location has horrible customer service .
the food is not as good as i expected . the fried chicken does not come with sauce . but what makes me most disappointed is they ask us to leave when we finish . i saw the waiting line there .
the garlic sauce is very watery and bad . the owner gives you a tiny cup for drinks , and says that you can come back for a refill once '' .
what a terrible place . my so called trainer '' could barely speak full sentences let alone english . he kept pushing pills on me and was very distracted by all of his gym rat friends '' . he was not attentive .
the tech that worked on my car failed to mention the new scratches on my hood , trim , whispers , bent my antenna after the installation . after i called a new tech came it to take pictures but never heard anything else .
saw a review that said do n't order delivery because they did n't get their food but i saw more rave reviews and ordered anyway .
once the food cools down it does not taste good . everything was over salted and it became really hard to choke it down . the burger patty also had a weird bitter burnt taste to it .
i ordered a taco salad , as i was eating it , i almost cracked my tooth on a small rock or pebble . when i called to tell them , they said it was impossible and i must be mistaken . ridiculous .
this place is terrible . had 6 in our group . 5 of us ordered steak . all steaks came out raw . sent them back and two came back at the correct temp . the rest were overdone .
called charity towing company for a tow . they never showed up . definitely not reliable . do n't waste your time call someone else instead .
horrible ! the thai dynamite with chicken was way to sour , tasted like the kitchen went overboard with lime juice . the rice was mushy had a funky texture . my daughter got the chicken fried rice and she said it was flavorless and the chicken was chewy .
job was performed adequately -- cleaning up a few trees and taking down some smaller ones ; however , the crew broke our 6 month old driveway and also do not communicate well when they are going to show up at your house .
no convenience of using credit card here . terminals at the pump never works ! i simply hate to getting inside to pay for my gas !
we arrived 15 mins before closing time ( we hate doing ) , they were already closed . i called the number listed online and the phone transferred to the manager , who did n't seem frustrated the store was closed early .
me : do you have batteries ? clerk : yes , we do . eyes light up . the danger of needing batteries at 11 pm will involve paying a small fortune for an ancient dusty pack at the nearest convenience store .
no ! why does this place have 4 stars ? it deserves 2 at most ! vietnamese is one of my favorite cuisines , i have it a lot , and i 've never been disappointed like this .
called twice on the way here to confirm they have jet skis for rent , they said yes both time . last call was in line to park entrance to make sure before i paid $ 20 to park .
had a combo plate and lunch plate between two of us . tasted a little off but we thought really nothing of it . a couple hours later we both got the runs and a twisting knot in our stomachs and a crappy after taste in our throats .
this food is definitely not good for you . the chicken served seemed old and the biriyani we got also taste bad . i am not sure how this restaurant gets 4 stars . i remember leaving a similar review. but , it is not listed anymore .
horrible service i brought 5 guests to this establishment on january 2 , 2015 . my friend wanted to order a drink that was not listed on the menu . the waitress stated that the drink could not be made nor did she understand how to ring it up .
can the slices get any smaller ? i felt like i was making a kids sandwich , i do n't recommend .
i really do n't like to write bad reviews , stopped in to willie ty 's previously and thought the food was meh , a yelpers term for okay i guess .
this place is crap . disregard the one star rating . did n't want to give any stars to this place ! worst doctor ever . not personable or friendly . only does his job for money and does n't care bout his patients .
i have a home warranty and called for a repair to dishwasher , the dry cycle was n't working . the first time they came my dad was here to let them in . they told him nothing was wrong and left with my $ 75.00 .
i do n't understand how hard it is to comprehend food orders , apparently extremely for these people . i have ordered the same thing every time i come here and it is always wrong .
the customer service sucks . i got my eye tested on august 22 , 2012 . i got my glasses online from another place in september 20 , 2012 . my right is blurry looking out of my new glasses .
did we go on a slow night ? the guest elevators were right by this place so we got so many vip passes that we decided to check it out towards the end of our trip .
cesar was a complete jerk , extremely rude . told me i was completely wrong about my information when it was information i had gotten from the same verizon store. do n't waste your time coming here .
this store has the worst customer service . one checkout line open , no matter what time of day it is . the employees are unfriendly and outright rude !
i have very low expectations , after all this is las vegas , i was just happy to have someone who showed up month after month . looks like that is all i can expect from this company . i had 3 large plants die on their watch .
showed up at 8:30 for one of the delicious milkshakes with all my friends . crazy bummed out this place was closed even though the signage and hours of operation show they close at 9 . they should either post signage they are closing early or something .
ordered enchiladas , they did n't resemble an enchilada , came in iron skillet looking like a glob of cheese with a few pieces of dry chicken on top and no tortilla in sight . i was told they are in there somewhere . it tasted terrible .
planned to come here for a girls night out as it was a convenient location for our group . there was lots of space when we arrived and we were seated quite quickly . the waiter kept referring to me a doll '' .
i wish i could figure out how to put 0 stars . i went here with a group of friends our first night in vegas . service sucked , food sucked .
do n't buy anything from here ! their cigars are dry . the walk-in humidor '' is sub par ! i purchased a $ 35 dollar blazer torch lighter . after filling it with butane i discovered it had no spark , broken !
we ordered carbonara , but it was made with alfredo sauce . not impressed . perhaps we ordered the wrong food . could their pizza be any better ? not sure if i want to find out .
worst experience ever . hated how chicken kebab tasted . the side salad was what i liked the most .
the male tech '' cut himself , and did not put a bandaid on. he started bleeding on me . literally . i had his blood on me .
worse experience ever . wait for assistant from front office for basically 20 mins and received a unpleasant answer for not having internet access in 4 hours during the day . the buffet is disgusting !
well shit . it took us a few visits to realize that they do n't properly sterilize the equipment for our pedis . the man ( owner ?
how unusual is this place ? as soon as i walked into the store they acted like i did n't know what kind of business i stepped foot in . really weird how selective they are with handling potential customers .
smelly environment , long lines when i go in there during the day . the employees do not look very happy and it reflects in their attitudes .
we have frequented this establishment quite often before new ownership took over a few months ago and always has exceptional service . since the new owners took over the service is awful .
long time of waiting why do u male an appointment if take you over 2 hr to be seen ? nice people nice doctors but . they ca n't make appointments . need to find a different doctor .
this place was terrible . bartenders were more interested in drinking with their friends than serving on a crowded saturday . got two beers and asked for a menu . got that and she never came back .
we thought this would be a good place to celebrate my brothers birthday since we have been to other locations and had good experiences . we were wrong .
i paid $ 15 for a tiny overcooked steak and a tiny baked potato . i ordered my steak medium rare and it was well done . server apologized but did n't do anything to make it right .
i always surprised at what canadians will accept as edible . food is below sub par they must be surviving in their bar tabs and location . we waited 45 mins for food and salad was wilted having sat under the lamps . service not good slow .
absolutely horrible . just horrible ! if you decide to sign up with this poor excuse for cable or internet service , be prepared to get a bill for a different and higher amount each month .
came to my house , measured , told me the 'd have a bid for me on a privacy fence and never called me back . guess they did n't want the business . therefore , one of their many competitors obtained my business .
i came here to study . thinking a library would be peaceful & quiet enough to concentrate . this library is rather unique .
this place is awful . they are a tequila bar but do n't even offer a cocktail list . they do n't even list the price of the house margarita ( like 11 and change or something '' when i asked the bartender ) in the menu .
i was hoping they would be better than the one on lv blvd . not . the peach cobbler was totally burned . do n't even know why they bothered to sell that to anybody . the mac and cheese as usual is over cooked . i tried .
we contacted bosco for a floor sewer drain backed up .
yes , prices are too high for poor food quality . this is a slot joint with cheap high priced food .
used to be great , last two times we went , sushi has been tiny pieces and not that great . anyone know of a good sushi place in vegas
nice place to come and chill with a good flow of indoor and outdoor spaces but this is not a sports bar . i went to see an nba playoff game and i asked for game volume . i was told they only do volume for important games . ''
a republic truck was going way , way too fast in our small neighborhood where the speed limit is only 15 mph . ii called the office to ask that the drivers be advised to observe this speed limit .
so the lady helping doesnt have her contacts in . do n't you think that would be the first thing you would do in the morning if you worked at a print shop ?
agree with other review i will never go back waited 3-4 minutes to order- drive thru should have known better one car backed out as i got there only one car ahead when i ordered but two when i went to pay .
short and sweet for this review , terrible experience with this company . on wedding day , bus arrived in filthy condition and stunk like seafood had been in it . secondly , the size of the bus upon arrival was not what was discussed prior to making arrangements .
showed up and more than half the menu was n't available . this included having no roti . no idea what is going on here .
waited 85 minutes for delivery that was supposed to be 45 . called twice . finally they say that they just sent the food out and it should be another 40 minutes .
i think this place has closed . no cars there for the last few days and their phone number does n't seem to work anymore .
i got a western bacon cheese burger , the meat was overcooked , bun soggy , cheese cooked away dry , i think they microwaved this thing , i never learn , not the first time to experience horrible food
i 've called this phone number several times and left messages and received no response . disappointing because we 've used them in the past and they did great work . maybe their out of business ?
i would not recommend this apartment complex to anyone . several negatives affect this review : 1 . my car was broken into ! this is a gated '' community where the gate does n't work half of the time ! 2 .
horrible ! i 've been living in the neighborhood for 15 years and have unfortunately ordered at this kfc dozens of times . i ca n't think of a single time where something was n't wrong with the orders . they manage to screw up anything !
this is the first loft location i 've been to where the associates have not been friendly . i was the only one in the store , yet nobody greeted me or approached me to offer any help .
i like love stand up comedy and know the rules to seating , pay more and or get there early . well , we did both and were handed tables near the back , not in the first four rows '' as promised with the upgraded ticket .
terrible food that made me sick . awful service . and oddly enough , i got the same interaction regarding sides '' that others have posted here .
absolutely horrid customer service i was waiting around for an hour or two before i got helped in the garden center .
the worst ever chinese restaurant if we can call this place as restaurant ! i ordered lo mien with steak , it was n't even steak and it was cold enough ! future actions : will not come again for sure !
the food here was awful ! price 's were crazy , average meal per person 25.00 . the sides including collard greens were either from cans or badly prepared from instant packaging . the meat . .i wo n't go there !
the food is good . i have been 4 times and the service has always been horrible . 20 minutes to get a diet coke after having to call the manager . this is the last time i am going there .
very bad rude people , as soon as we got in they told us they close at 12:30am meanwhile i told them their hours are listed at until 1 am on yelp ! they are rude and liars . do n't go to eat here !
i was sold '' by sales rep derek , who was very arrogant , to purchase glass case cover for $ 40 and no otter box as the glass front would cover any breakage !
i got my eyebrows waxed today and although i said my main problem was above the brow & temple area she waxed below the brow too . which resulted in a burn under my right eyebrow on my eyelid skin where i know there wasnt even hair .
sorry , folks . this is another peoria surprise glendale pizza place i can take off my list . went there tonight - eat in - ordered a pepperoni & onion pizza .
do n't do business with pitney bowes ! one of the worse businesses i 've ever dealt with ! my husband used pitney bowes for 12 years even though the prices were n't the best . when he sold his business we called to close his accounts .
horrible experience was treated unfairly . was rude and took over an hour and was eating while working . after my phone was fixed he did n't bother to let me know that my sensor button would n't function properly at first .
ok , move out time and this company is dragging their feet on getting me my refund .
usually when you walk into a business like this you are greeted . i walked in and both girls sitting at the front desk were very unprofessional and straight out rude . never again will i come here .
terrible . told them 1 inch , they took of 4 inches . they do n't know how to cut hair . i would n't go there unless you want all of your hair chopped off . they do n't really make conversation with you either .
mediocre place for burritos , definitely had better ones . i ordered a small chicken burrito ( ~ $ 8 ) . you got to customize what you wanted in the burrito , similar to subway .
food was okay but service was terrible . we had reservations for 4 at 7pm . felt rushed to eat and give up table . we will never be back . asked for manager but never happened .
one stars only cause one maintenance guy is great ! this apartment has been an nightmare . no joke i have been having the worst experience . scorpions , bugs , and dirty never cleaned community pools . the pool water is literally green .
worst manicure and pedicure experience i have ever had . i am visiting from california and we came to pro nails because another shop we stopped at was booked up .
they do n't even deserve one star . they were completely rude ! i confirmed the price multiple times over the phone before i brought my scooter down . and when i came to pick it up they told me a completely different price .
i hope the owner reads these comments because we used to love coming here because of the food and service . we tried calling in our order because we hate waiting for the food here now , it takes forever !
i am a resident of boulder city and have never been here . for lunch last week i ordered a veggie cheese steak which took 35 min to make .
dont bring your dogs here ! i would n't suggest this place to anyone . especially people who care about their dogs the way i do . my dog came home very i 'll after being boarded here .
i just moved to vegas from new york . can not believe there is a company that is worse then time warner cable . wtf . i stayed home all day , and the tech never show up . now that i read the reviews .
horrid food . my colleague , his wife and i went here looking for a pre flight lunch . our hopes for having found a good bbq were shot down quickly , though . the food came on styrofoam plates . the utensils were individually wrapped plastic settings .
when entering this place , it smelt like the whole place was mopped with dirty old water . the seats and table tops were dirty and the whole place gave out a old stingy vibe .
these people are terrible ! incredibly rude and do n't do anything close to a good job . i would leave a 0 if i could . i brought my wedding dress there right after my wedding , they told me it would take a month .
i was extremely excited to try this place since there are n't alot of thai places near me . unfortunately i was extremely disappointed by the food . i ordered the yellow curry with chicken and shrimp fried rice .
first time great and reasonably priced for fries , boneless buffalo wings and dips . second time was good , third time was okay , overcharged for same thing and did n't even get the waffle fries . this fourth time is the last time .
i bought shoes in april through my payroll deduction returned them and six months later still waiting on my refund . wonder how many folks get ripped off cause they do n't follow through assuming it will be refunded on the payroll .
si senor used to be family favorite . have n't been there in almost three years up until today . we were disappointed at how much the quality in service and the quantity of food has declined with increased prices .
i used to love this place . what happened ? my steak was purple and inedible and the waiter never commented when i basically ate nothing on my plate .
i wrote a review for this resort banquet space they have and they took it out . just to let you know i was writing review for oasis rv resort banquet space and not oasis banquet space .
salon receptionist was so completely rude and because she was so rude ulta salon at great northern lost a $ 400 plus tip salon sale .
went there a year ago , first and last time being there . food was good . however , besides another group of 2 , my gf and i were the only ones in the restaurant .
just placed an order on uber eats for the tabouli salad with chicken . they do n't offer the option of the shirazi sales with meat but the salad is the same base price as the tabouli salad .
i agree with all the other reviews . rude . condescending . one hand does n't know what the other is doing . empty promises . terrible maintenance . they hold rent checks .
average food , no soap in restroom and managment limiting usage of dish bowls and even pointing it out to u without a damn for customer experience ! so beware if use a bowl for a daal as per the manager it is for desserts or sambar only .
walgreens customer service stinks . one of the managers gave me attitude at the register one day and i felt like reporting her to upper management but did n't waste my time .
no individual service and rude reaction to the simple request of a bouquet for a bridal shower . no individual bouquets available . do not shop here if you except service . this shop will not get my business .
i generally avoid walmart at all costs , but i go every once in a while if i need something specific . this is by far the most ratchet walmart in the phoenix area ! very rude customer service over the phone .
if you like karaoke , come here . if you like food , do not . we waited almost two hours for our food and when it arrived no one ate it because it tasted like a leather shoe .
waited 10 minutes in line for change for a $ 100 bill . which never showed up . took only the one thing i needed and left the rest . paid by credit card when i did not want to just so i could finally get out of there .
total bait and switch . i bought a deal for 5 car window tinting from living social . they did not want to honor it and wanted me to pay an extra 50.00 . no thanks . no honesty in this company .
i am not sure what had gone wrong . i went here a few months back and whatever i ordered ( sushi rolls ) smelt like skunk and despite the fact i tried to taste it and the taste was not good .
1 ) add their facebook page as they frequently have discounts only for facebook fans . 2 ) come here on the 1st of every month to have a $ 2 discount on your doodle ( must be a regular cup ) .
i experience racial profiling during my visit at this store .
ordered a schezwan chicken take-out at maximum spicy level , but was extremely disappointed to find no spices in the chicken at all . besides , some of the chicken was under-cooked . the best part of this super bowl meal was a can of coca cola .
they need to fire melissa - she is a complete sociopath who hates men . if you are unlucky enough to get this crazy lady in the rotation - watch out . and for god 's sake do n't call her sweetie or she will come unglued .
do not buy gas here . they will take your cash and refuse to pump gas . filing a police report now .
zero stars if i could . bought my groupon on 06 12 . texted for appt to use it as per the directions . was told she was on vacation until july 1st . ( i mean really ) who wants to wait that long for a beauty service ?
do not recommend ! i called to let them know i was running late because i was coming in from happy valley .
let 's just say they saw 2 females , myself and my daughter , walk in the door ( actually we barely got out of the car ) and assumed they would be able to basically take us to the cleaners .
after waiting in line for some time i left my items and left . one customer was waited on during this time . there was a problem and the cashier just kept hitting the same button over and over .
we came in to check it out and we did n't smell any bbq ! really , i 've never been to a bbq restaurant that did n't have any smell of bbq .
after planning my day around the friday 2:05 turbo tournament i registered and waited for over an hour only to hear them announce that they were canceling the tournament five minutes before it was scheduled to start . very unprofessional .
first time and last time there . horrible and unfriendly staff , and if you want to see real flamenco dancing please do not waste your time and money to go there ! the groupon offer they have is a complete sham !
worse tour ever with gc tours !
ca n't believe how rude the drive-thru employee krystal is ! worst starbucks experience ever . did not even get my drink right .
our visit sounded more like a visit to the emergency room . there was plenty of sneezing , wheezing , itching , and overall difficulty breathing . the cause : a clueless couple and their hairy cat .
if i could give this place a half star i would . i watched this bar coffee house deli caribbean cooker be built for 6 months with hopes that it would be a place i could get some good food and drink .
the service i have received from this company has gotten progressively worse as time has gone on . i would not recommend this company to anyone . they have been no shows when they scheduled us and they have appeared without notifying us .
awful experience . mushy wings . incredibly slow service . took 1 hour and 10 minutes to get our second round of wings on all you can eat wing night . funny tasting beers .
you 're a soccer establishment but you do n't allow soccer shoes in your restaurant ? what a joke ! who runs this place ? it 's like playing golf and then being told you ca n't wear golf shoes in the clubhouse . idiots !
bad service but really good food pretty much sums it up . rude waitress and inattentive servers . seemed like they were in a hurry to hand us the bill .
can i give negative stars ? we will never use this company for any business in the future . rude , unprofessional . did i say rude ? do n't waste your time with this awful business !
i was not impressed by this restaurant at all . the flooring is all carpeting and it is disgusting . please vacuum and deep clean it . even better just replace that nasty floor . the menu was dirty and sticky . just clean the restaurant !
we love italian food . for the price of the food you can find much much much much better . the servings was incredibly small , the food was decent at best , and the people around you are all of oakville 's elite snobs .
if i could give negative stars i would . lousy service , we sat down for 20mins before we got our tea , lousy food , singapore noodle was wet and the vermicelli was in bits . the curry had no taste and they used pita bread as roti .
i 'm sorry , but i have had consistently bad service every time i eat here . the waitstaff act more like an annoying friend rather than a server . for me this is really only one step up from a fazoli 's .
too bad they like to lie about a dogs temperament when i have been bringing my dogs to them for almost 8 years !
i have visited this location three times . the staff is nice , but they get the order wrong every time and sometimes they are out of things that should be standard for an ice cream shop ( out of hot fudge ? at 6pm ? )
the drive through person flirted with me for two minutes until i finally drove away ! they mess up my order every time we go there ! and they are rude , unkind , and snobby to us . all we have been is nice !
poor customer service ! ordered halo halo ( 7.99 ) for pick up i went in and the cashier did not even acknowledged my presence . just left . server name who did that is kessler ( his name plate )
the minute clinic is awful . i went in for a simple vaccine and waited for 2 hours . never got the vaccine . at their 5:30 closing time they said i never signed in , but my name appeared on their kiosk .
we 've been here twice . the first was 5 stars and the second was 1 star . it is also a bit too pricey to have a one star experience . we are not sure we would want to go back after our last visit .
if i could i would give negative stars . i called this afternoon and made an appointment for later in evening . i arrive 5 minutes before my appointment and lady says , her partner didnt tell her about my appointment and they cant do it . lack professionalism .
these 5 star reviews are all fake . firstly , the shop is not located at this address . when you call the number they will tell you that the shop is located on east sharp circle in north las vegas .
came to this place to sell my lightly used winter tires . after testing and verified that my tires are in great shape with no leak , a guy walked up and told me that he is paying $ 25 a piece .
i actually crave the msg in their food every once in while . my recent experience has caused me to rethink . there is a good reason why there is a sign up front says make sure you get your receipt or your meal is free .
i went in a month ago and my haircut was horrible . i had razor marks in my head . so i went home and shaved my head . i went back today and was rushed thru and the left side of my head was n't finished .
avoid at all costs . this company has recently rebranded as sapphire resorts so avoid them too . i sat through a 3 hr high pressure sales pitch on time shares with the promise of a free vacation after .
every time we order from here the food tastes horrible sometimes cold , there 's always a bunch of customers in line and workers scrambling to get it together . there 's always only one maybe two cashiers open .
goodness , where do i begin ? i have been going to this store every time i come to town square with or without my dogs . today , i came in and was n't greeted ( which is fine ) but usually someone always says hi ! ''
had dinner at urban grill or as it should be called ugg . the menu was rather small with just a few pasta and meat dishes . the biggest part of the menu was the starters which i wish i had ordered from .
this place is horrible ! do not take your business here . they are incompetent , rude , and lazy .
this used to be a great place to eat but now the service and food are terrible . not sure why the owner has lost interest but clearly he has lost touch .
worst customer service . the owner acts like its an inconvenience that you even order from here . whenever my boyfriend and i would come she always would act annoyed at us . very uncomfortable and unprofessional .
my friend and i came in for a late lunch around 2:30pm and we were greeted and seated quickly , since there was nobody here . i ordered the calamari and my friend ordered the iceberg salad .
i joined yelp so no one else would make a mistake and buy pizza from here . this pizza stunk . no flavor , almost no toppings , 15 bucks for a tiny pizza , and i actually wish i would have bought a pizza from aldi .
i 've been here many times . it 's really just a sports bar but used to have pretty good food . they have good fish on fridays and the clam chowder is always tastey too . the service is often slow .
no public '' restrooms for customers .
i have had one out of three breakfasts here that was good . you 'd think a breakfast restaurant could do poached eggs ! no . second time , too hard ; third time , runny and full of vinegar . coffee , tasteless . potatoes not crisp .
we brought in our cockapoo for a full grooming right before thanksgiving . the lady behind the counter acted like she knew exactly what we wanted our dog to look like and even assured us he would get a teddy bear cut '' .
i 'm so disappointed in the new ownership here . does anyone know what happened to nikki and brandon ? last i saw them they were going on vacation to korea and would be back in 5 weeks .
if you want a sales person who pushes a ridiculously priced bike right off the get go then this place is for you . looking for a road bike they suggested there $ 7000 bike right away lol .
total scam . they took my money and then changed the dates and will not issue refund . read reviews people . i wish i had .
i guess there is no way to really make amtrak improve by making a one-star review , but i think it 's awful how expensive it now is to go to chicago given the quality of the service .
my experience at fulton place apartments has been a horrible first time renting experience . the state of the apartment walking into it was deplorable and i had to clean before i even moved in .
the woman who works at this shop is rude and obnoxious . she tells you what she wants and does n't care what you want .
extremely disappointed with the lack of customer service at this store . not only was the original form of payment declined , samsung pay , but the cashier treated us very poorly .
this place is a rip off ! frank is a liar to me and said it was going to be $ 40 then it turned out to be $ 58 .
i am so disappointed and if i could give a zero star review i would . we had to ask our waiter for our drinks , refills for our drinks and talk to the manager to actually get our refills .
called in for a pickup order and was told it would be 30 minutes . when we got there we waited another 20 minutes for our order . i saw the pizza and fries sitting on top of the oven and i knew we were waiting for the calzone .
very small takeout portions , and we ordered the xl raw beef and flank pho . i would say maybe 4 mouthfuls of meat and the rest was broken noodles . there was also no flank . they only take cash and debit .
i 've kept coming back hoping the service would be better just because this location is convenient . .this will be my last time . everybody here , every single time acts like you are bothering them .
i just left this place . the nail tech argued with me about what package i chose , when i asked that they use the grater instead of the sponge he told me that there were no upgrades . ''
terrible customer service . do n't try to do an exchange or refund with them , it 's a hassle . will definitely be calling corporate .
the food was awful and very bland . the only thing good was the service . we will not return .
this place is a dump . half the menu from the website is not actually being served anymore and they are never open during business hours . having a restaurant is a business not a hobby .
customer service sucks here ! at the mobile section there is 5 people working on one customer with a handful of people waiting to be helped . to ask a question seemed as if we were pulling out a kidney or something .
do n't eat here . the pizza is weak . we paid 27 bucks for 2 10 '' garbage pizzas
food is good . our server was mediocre . he was waiting the whole ( near empty ) restaurant alone ; but did n't seem to mind as he laughed with the other servers who sat in a booth .
i am writing this as i am sitting here at the restaurant . i was starving and wanted fresh breakfast food and all i can really say is , what a huge disappointment !
okay hotel - you get what you pay for . hotel was clean , which is important to me . however , when making the reservation the website claimed continental breakfast '' which the hotel did not provide .
waited in the drive thru for over 40 minutes . meal was n't even put in ( per the receipt ) until almost 20 minutes after i ordered . so after 40 minutes and no food i ask for a refund .
to all those who are planning to have some fun in vegas , please avoid staying in harrahs , 1 ) just to get in to the hotel from the main strip is a big thing from n number of stop signs and speed bumps .
new york style pizza ? i think not ! have n't been in awhile so thought i would order take out . big mistake .
i dropped off my rifle to be inspected for problems with light hammer strikes and a bolt that would not stay open when the last round was fired .
i cant believe bank of america would still continue to charge overdraft fees for items that did n't even process and my account was negative to begin with . nothing was done to help me . i was just another person they pushed away !
usually i give it higher stars . i am a frequent visitor late night . usually the waiters and waitresses are amazing . never had a complaint . well i come tonight ( tuesday ) there are a few people in the place but i would n't consider busy .
loved this place for over 12 years . turned into a dump '' a year ago and never recovered . last time there the silverware , glasses and tea cups were dirty . glass had old lipstick on it . heard its closed , not surprised .
juan stole my money , wo n't return phone calls or emails . i have a small claims case pending , he will be contacted shortly .
this place has everything to be a great local italian place except one thing , good italian food ! i had the spaghetti with italian sausage . what i got did n't look like any plate of spaghetti i 've ever seen .
do n't waste your time on this place . they have something called a hookah wait '' which means and i quote you pay for your hookah now but i 'm not sure when you will get it .
always out of food past 8:30pm . they are open until 10 but refuse to cook past 8:30 . why stay open ? this has happened to me numerous times and when i confronted management ; they act like i am lying . i emailed corporate .
they always get my order wrong plus they burn their coffee . i 'd rather wait in line for a better cup of coffee then to be rushed through . for some odd reason my order is n't as bad as long as i drive through .
regularly on hold for at least 30 minutes , if not an hour . hire someone to answer the goddamn phone .
so , so unbelievably expensive . nice owner , but $ 51 for a jacket to be dry cleaned ? no . never again .
two bad haircuts in a row . i am done with great clips . bad haircut in september , took three months to grow it back out . went in with a picture of exactly want i wanted . ignored . cut it back above my ears again .
this pharmacy has horrible customer service . at another local cvs , they will print out pharmacy records in advance and hand them to you through the drive-through window , after you provide your id .
every time i go there i wait much longer than they tell me . i have n't had a problem with the work they do , but just shoot me straight with the time . today i went in for an oil change and a tire rotation .
centurylink is the absolute worst company i 've ever dealt with . prism tv is horrible . you ca n't watch live tv while using dvr at the same time and their internet has issues constantly .
absolutely terrible service . sat at the table for 10 minutes before the waiter even stopped by to take a drink order , and he was rude the entire evening . same if not worse experience waiting to order food . food was not good .
this place gave the worst service i have ever had . they have a policy that they will not seat you unless your whole party is there .
customer service is dreadful . do n't expect return calls as they do n't happen . one star is exceeding the quality of service received . this review is for the scottsdale office
horrible service . got home with the wrong order & i have to go pick it up unless i want to wait 45 minutes for them to deliver the correct order . annoyed !
stay away from these con artists they do not warranty any of their defective products . i bought 4 brand new tires from them and within 1 month all 4 tires split on the sidewall .
nice rooms but horrible experience . long story short we are in room 130 . right next to the side door where we heard people coming and going all night -- and so did our dog . the other worse issue was the ceiling .
my family visited this store last night at 10:05 . a family of 4-5 was in line being served . the female employee told us they were closed . i asked if we could be served because they were serving the other family .
burgers were way overdone and dryer than dirt . my kids would n't even eat their burgers , they opted for broccoli instead . i think jack in the box should be renamed crap in the bag .
wish i could give zero stars . the people in the front were mediocre at best when checking in .
gross gross and unsafe ! broken cars , dirty trash areas and ridiculous office staff . not sure why anyone would ever want to live here .
went to this locations was over charged , the receipt absolutely made no sense .
so , mother always said if you ca n't say something nice do n't say anything at all .
i have american home shield insurance and submitted a service request . i spoke with the receptionist who called to make the appointment and let her know that my spring had broken on my garage door .
gross ! it honestly tastes like they took some dirty ass tepid water from lake mead and added a little bit of yeast and hops to it .
went to scottsdale rv because they were the only dealership that carried the brand and model that we were interested in . i totally ca n't understand the great reviews on this place . i have never seen such a dirty , disorganized place of business in quite awhile .
they came out to do an estimate , told me i would have something in my email in a few days , and i never heard from them again . it has now been almost two weeks . i guess my job is to small potatoes for them !
i do not recommend using this company . if you do , make sure you understand all of their fees in advance . they did not disclose their trip and fuel charges in advance .
called to try and schedule an appointment today . after providing insurance information , magically there were no appointments available until january 1st of next year ( when my current plan wo n't be available ) .
nothing fast about this place . do n't bother checking in online because like they let you know it 's only a check in time not an appt . learned that one the hard way after i sat in the lobby for 2 hours after my check in time .
the owner of the salon is very rude . she need a lesson in customer service . i would not recommend this place at all ! she is rude beyond words . i will never go back again !
ca n't find anyone need to cut a sheet of drywall all of the employees state at you . f-
the worst place ever . the woman working was nice but the man doing my nails was so unhappy and rude . i had got my nails done here five days ago and they are already lifting and growing out . he did such a half ass job .
walked in to have a script filled . was told to wait in line . they checked my insurance which did not apply until the next day . mind you : i am new to the area and the pharm tech was told that .
not a very experience with getting order for allergens , my daughter is allergic to wheat , and dairy and every time i order here it looks like it is such trouble to accommodate for allergens .
i really hate leaving this review because i visited before and thought things were getting better . we ended up spending 70.00 on a meal we thought we could use a coupon for . and , it was totally not worth the money at all .
this is my first ever , negative yelp review and i 'll keep it short and not sweet . i experienced horrible customer service when i went to get lunch with a friend . i 've never had such an unwelcoming experience from any food service establishment .
i do n't know where to start . came in with an appointment for a gel manicure and regular pedicure . i noticed how the polishes were very very cheap and ask if i could use a gel polish instead and wait for it to dry .
terrible service , the guy was on the phone the entire time we were there . did not assist us in any way . and charged $ 0.50 for the little cap to try on wigs . will never go in that store again .
please do n't go here please do n't . my nails broke 2 days after receiving a full set i paid 50 bucks just to go back and have the same nails that were fixed break the very next day .
if i could make it zero star 's , i would . these people are the rudest idiots i have ever dealt with . they will send you a bill for no reason after your insurance company has already paid for everything .
i have n't seen a bigger collection of freaks , misfits , and dregs of society since the cantina scene in star wars .
not good . have had better frozen pizza . they skimp ed on everything on the pizza including taste . they would have had to triple amount of toppings to salvage the pizza . pieology is better and that place is n't very good .
i came here specifically for underwear night . lame ! only me and my bf were in our underwear . and there were only 5 other people here . never again !
they could n't fix my truck after they charged me $ 1,000 ! they said it was the a c compressor so i fixed it and by the time i drive it home it was overheating still .
i had such high expectations for diesel based on reviews i heard from my friends . it seemed like the place to be ! visited with several friends and my boyfriend and we walked in very late one night .
the bun bo hue ( spicy beef noodle soup ) was the worst food dish i 've had for a year .
i have been here for lunch several times , and it is a good value . not great . food is cheap which is why i went today with a friend , just because i have eaten out a lot lately and wanted to save a bit .
love the pizza , the manager , not so much . i 've been ordering for delivery for over two years at our new house , and one day the manager says its out of the delivery area .
what is with the hype ? i 've eaten here twice . the first time was about 2 years ago and it was mediocre to bad . for some reason i went back tonight to give it a second chance , and it was even worse than i remembered .
too bad you ca n't put negative stars . this place is just dirty and disgusting overall . cardboard is better . only pizza in my life where i 've had to pick off pepperoni and leave the crust as it was too gross to handle .
ali is the worst promoter he will put you down for no reason ! it 's my birthday and he ruined it ! i did love drais but honestly he ruined my whole night ! i would n't use him !
this place might be good for ordering dinner at home , but when you are trying to order for a large group , forget it . the last time we ordered from them for a large lunch , they screwed up the order .
worst experience ever . i have been sitting in the front of the restaraunt for 20 minutes waiting for our order .
i have been to several of these , mostly tatum cactus . although they are speedy and attentive to you , the quality is poor . they always do a subpar job on your vehicle , probably because they are so rushed . the attention to detail is missed .
my girlfriend and i came to small town food co. on a whim -- this was not a good decision at all . you pay $ 8 for some tater tots '' i.e . pieces of potato with lukewarm gravy and cheap ground beef with scattered peas .
i would not recommend this barbershop to anyone , if your not black your not really welcomed here , at least that is the feeling i got , and what i observed .
avoid this place . do n't fall for the reservation system here . reservations mean nothing here and are a sham that they use to bring people in . once you 're there , they mean nothing .
we arrived for our thanksgiving reservation at 6:15 and the host said we 're in limbo '' right now please take a seat at the bar or wait for your table .
worst move experience ever , before even hiring them i was told they were insured and bonded . that three guys would be better than 2 because it would be quicker and less money .
i stopped in here today for lunch since i was in the area . the service was friendly and nice . i ordered the carne asada tacos . first i got chips and went to the salsa bar .
coffee is usually good , today they had to finish brewing the decaf . i waited and what did i end up with , a cup full of coffee grounds .
the food this morning was sub-par . they are now using frozen and canned produce and they increased their prices . we ordered pancakes and there was a hair in it . for that , the server apologized .
wow , what a disappointing affair ( 2014 ) .
my husband and i went in for a 1 buzz and a bang trim . it 's hard to mess up a buzz so my husband is fine but my bangs are a crying shame .
went in and sat down , was greeted by a really nice waitress and the menu looked great .
i was getting my breakfast , and i was in the drive thru i gave the cashier my money then i pulled up to line 2 that says pick up .
a menu and brand that poorly rips off jack astor 's . awful service , and warm disgusting beer was the special of the day . we walked out after our server forgot we were there .
had dinner here tonight , ordered the zocalo pork chimichanga . what a disappointment . the chimichanga had more pork fat than pork , big chunks of fat ? the sauce was bland , and the cheese became a big ball .
we went here a few weeks ago and i was less than impressed . i 'm not a huge fan of sweets , but frozen yogurt is my weakness .
the food was absolutely terrible and so was the service . none of our 12 guests enjoyed their food . the atmosphere has also changed compared to when i originally visited this restaurant a few years back . it has lost its lounge type feel .
my girlfriend ordered a calzone and it was not fully cooked . the dough on the outside was golden brown but the inside was not cooked at all . she took it back and they would not give her money back only offered a store credit .
although it is clean , the atmosphere is loud . the staff is not very friendly and seldom talk to the customer , rather speak only to each other .
it took over two hours to get in and out with a small party . the server did not know what to do . bad service , but the food was good .
loaded the mcdonald 's app and everything was great until i stopped at this location and ordered a mocha and a sandwich that came with free hash browns as the offer on the app . i have also asked to scan the punch card for the drink .
went in with a friend around 745 tonight . there was no one else in line and 3 associates in the drive thru area , all three looked at us and kept doing what they were doing .
do yourselves a favor please please please do n't stay here . unless you 're into bugs , slow service , people coming in and out complaining , dirty rooms , unwashed towels and linens . if you want to ruin your vegas trip stay here .
i told them they could do any day and i would come early as necessary as long as i could be first in line . i came when they told me and was 8th in line .
terrible . overbooked and forced to wait an hour over appointment time after time . if insurance let me go to other doctors would in a heartbeat . poor bedside manner not too friendly . very disappointed .
worst place to eat at ! terrible service and terrible food ! i looked this place up online while sitting on the toilet from there disgusting food , all i saw was criticism ! will never eat at eat n park again because of this restaurant .
the guy took almost an hour and a half to fuck up a fifteen minute haircut . i grew my hair for eight months for this haircut . then he blames me for it . he told me i tried to tell him to give me a fade .
they wo n't do anything to help . they are full of shit . never will get past the a phone call . my wife is scared for life . all they can think about is how to cover it up .
after waiting 2 hours with an infant , he was unable to look at her eye because she was exhausted and squirmy .
unfortunately i can not say anything good about this place , because i had no possibility to try it . the reason is , that it was impossible to get in touch with her no matter what i 've tried .
worst experience ever ! went to enjoy a birthday lunch only to recieve a bowl of grease and oil not once but twice ! if i could give no stars i would !
cheap crappy shoes that fell apart after three uses . three . we are n't talking marathon here just everyday wear . spoke to clerk who said we could being back .
wow . i am speechless . it turns out that my late fees exceeded the normal amount i would pay for accounting fees ( which peter originally said he 'd cover ) . turns out that the late fees exceed the accounting fees .
a friend recommended this bar and my first impression was i found the staff pushy . they kept on coming up to check my drink every two minutes . i was told it was laid back atmosphere and it was far from it .
this pizza is complete crap ! not cheap either . the pizza was like flatbread and it tasted like cardboard . yuck !
awful , awful customer service ! ordered flowers online for mothers day . received a confirmation number , yet order was never processed and delivered . imagine my surprise when i asked my mother if she liked the flowers .
horrible customer service ! went in to buy a tree and asked trevor '' to help me out . he said no one buys plants this time of year and when i insisted i wanted one , he said he offers no guarantee and it will die .
completely rude receptionist on the phone .
when i asked the bartender what was on tap , she said those 10 '' and pointed towards the taps insinuating that i was to leave my seat and go look for myself . in all my years never had i had been told to go look for myself .
as usual , terrible service here . they keep trying to change management to improve but it only gets worse !
i was absolutely appalled by the way we were treated yesterday at the store . i came in with my mother and we were looking around .
ok , this is the 4th time i 've found a car online at this dealership only to go in and find out it does n't exist . unlucky coincidence or shady business practices ?
dirty , unkept , messy dining area , windows , bathroom , dirty floors , counters . no team pride here and this is goodyear a nice neighborhood . where is the pride ? been here before and was just as dirty . look at the pictures .
well gave it another shot . .worse than last year . only three booths selling comics . poor selection not only in comics but figures , statues , and related comic items . very disappointing .
service was awful . food was very good . took forever to get food . waiter did n't speak english ; was rude .
we were here for weekend bunch a few times . we went today for lunch , what a disappointment . the new menu was much smaller and the service was non existent .
this place sucks what kinda of fast food restaurant runs out of lettuce and tortillas when there 's is smith in the same shopping center as them . worst customer service ever give me the runs .
beautiful resort - there is no denying that . however - they have the most unprofessional , rudest employees i have ever encountered . they offered no help , i was not greeted when i arrived nor did i get a smile .
unlike most of my reviews that usually have some wit or scathing sarcasm , this one just does n't . i went to this market once when i moved in to the neighborhood directly behind it and that was it .
prices are good here , however be very careful . if you have an issue and have to deal with customer service then i say buyer beware . they really could care less .
i bought some furniture from macy 's and have been extremely disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the delivery service . i had to replace a night stand three times because of defects . the worse part of this is the delivery of the furniture .
i did n't actually get to try the food . i visited on 1 23 15 at 7pm . we waited at the front door for 5 minutes without anyone greeting or seating us .
there are a few problems with this restaurants : 1 ) the way they put bunch of chop sticks on the table is so unsanitary . they are exposed to coughing , spit . for this reason i will not go back .
this is by far the worst location . and that 's really saying something considering how crappy pizza pizza is even at its best . the pizzas always seem slapped together with all the toppings piled right in the middle and hardly any cheese .
stopped by at 5:15pm on saturday for my wife . i walked in and it was only staffed with 1 person who does n't even give a massage . i asked how much it was and she stated 60 $ 60 minutes .
if i could give zero stars , i would . just got off the phone ( this is my fourth phone call ) with the manager who told me about their disorganization and blamed my consistent issues on everyone else , taking no responsibility .
worst customer service . my wife ordered from here for a pickup delivery because they charge $ 6 ( six ) dollars for delivery in the same zip code .
i had a horrible experience here . i purchased a vehicle them in cash . it was a used vehicle , so i arranged a 90 day warranty with them as well . the first week that i got me car , the radiator failed .
roland 's was recommended by hotel . service was terrible . food was cold . brick oven pizza cold . asked to have it reheated , still came back cold . steak was way over cooked . never got appetizer we ordered , but was charged for it .
been going here for about ten years now and i 've watched the service and food slowly decline . do n't get me wrong , the food still ranks as standard middle eastern fare however the place has lost all personality .
i 've had numerous concerns with this office since i started visiting two years ago , and i 'm finally leaving the office . i agree that the front desk staff is often rude , curt , and makes me feel as though i am an inconvenience .
slowest service , these workers basically do not care about your time they will see a full line and not attend to it until they are ready . ridiculously slow . do n't come here if you 're in a hurry .
i 'm not sure why my last post was removed - how are you guys doing this ? as i said in my last post , anything positive here is written by them , friends and family because this is the absolute worse place i 've ever been .
this place is terrible ! eat at your own risk . spent $ 65 for a very early dinner lunch on a sunday .
i just wanted a quick plain bagel . staff just hung around and took forever . asked it if i wanted it toasted , no . served me a cold bagel straight from fridge . why are they even open in morning .
very very very slow service . the guy put the wrong kind of sauce on my sandwich and rather than offering to make it again he sat there for five minutes and try to scrape it off with a knife and throwing parts of the sandwich away .
just tried to book an appointment . dude on the phone was rude as hell and hung up on me .
the dentist that i see here is fantastic but this office lacks trust with their patients at every step . every time you visit you must sign a consent form and they make you sign an invoice for every dental procedure before you start .
if you see this truck coming . run run run ! they came to my work and i ordered a korean bbq burger with fries . first guy in line and eager to see what they have .
worst buffet i have ever been to . the only saving grace was the mexican food station . even the dessert was terrible . how do you mess up soft serve ice cream ? trust me your better off going somewhere else .
the most disgusting experience i have ever had ! all three meals with raw tortillas , raw chicken , old cheese , old beans , never go there ! a picture says a thousand words !
poor . they refuse to listen to customers situations . went in twice over two weeks to get my options straight on weather or not to bring my old phone to a new plan or start all fresh .
this store is very similar to most dollar stores except for one thing . there is always an extremely long line to check out . i 've been there at 9am and 8pm does n't matter . line of at least 6-10 people .
i have gone there many times , the last few times my nail polish chipped very quickly . on my most recent visit i noticed one of the employees topping up partially used nail polish bottles with a clear fluid .
there 's a girl there i think her name is rachelle she was extremely rude when i asked for some drinks . she was constantly on her phone and seemed to ignore a lot of the other people there as well .
i 've always loved this location , because they always make my drink right . i have n't gone to starbucks in forever , so i finally decided to go tonight to get my caramel brûlée latte .
so disappointed i brought my girlfriend to dinner and there is a sign on door saying that they are not taking cards or credit cards or gift cards due to there machine down and it wo n't be fixed all day .
so , there 's no negative stars , too bad . tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it - good thing , you could n't pay me to eat here . the only thing about the colossal cobb salad i ordered was the price .
do not do business with this realtor company ! i over looked the reviews before recently moving in and it has been a huge mistake . i 've been over charged fees and harassed by renee .
this place had a really nice modern and clean look . when i arrived it was packed with people . mind you it was a tuesday night so i was excited to see what all the fuss was about . unfortunately the food quality was n't good .
not the place for decent customer treatment specially in the service department . worse if the used car you bought from this dealership is not a hyundai .
person answering the phone was short spoken and almost rude . i was quoted 45 min delivery and it was an hour . once delivered the pizza was cold , poor quality and somehow the two toppings were wrong ?
none of the food is fresh , almost all of the plates and silverware are dirty , the tables are filthy and sticky , and most of the food looks poorly made . a disappointing , overpriced experience .
do not come here ! my family was driving around north york looking for a place or a quick dinner , and figured we should try this restaurant .
i normally go to a different location but i was closer to this one , not thinking it would be a big deal . i was wrong . i literally saw one of the workers there use his two figures to pick his nose and seriously eat it .
people on yelp must be insane crazy to review this place as the best food . no offense to anyone but my experience was horrible . food - it is okay .
i moved . i 've told them by phone i no longer need a membership due to my move and i 'm not under contract .
had chipotle chicken sandwhich , hands down a solid 2 . nothing spectacular do n't understand the high reviews ? possibly bought ? also had the broccoli cheddar and tortilla soup . it was just ok no more than a 2 ! not worth the wait .
my friend made a appointment to get a pedicure and manicure for both of us . waited half a hour for pedicure . when all done waited another half hour to get manicure . which did not happen . as no one was available .
this evening i made an order for delivery . when it arrived i was charged a debit surcharge of $ 1.50 . which is illegal in quebec . i told the delivery person this , he told me that he often gets this feedback from customers .
worst service ever . never coming back . it was n't busy . i was ignored because i was by myself .
garlic knots are delicious . however , the pizza is n't the best . it was food court quality and i would n't have it again . $ 5 for a slice a pizza . not worth it ! my sister-in-law ordered a salad .
nice office , a good place if you 're looking for fast food style service . it 's fast and efficient , except for when you have a problem with billing .
the customer service was awful ! we were forced to buy insurance since the agent stated it was canada law for all international drivers . then he said we could pick $ 11 a day ; however we had to pay $ 12 plus another $ 30 for insurance .
stopped in for a quick drink alone whilst waiting on the ladies to finish a pedicure appointment . thought it would be a nice place to enjoy a drink and get some work done on my laptop . however , the wifi was n't working .
absolutely the worse experience i 've ever had at a veterinary hospital . they do n't fix your animals problem they just throw just about everything they can get you to buy and then try to get you back for more . do n't even waste your time !
there are so many things i can say about this store . the bathrooms are a mess , the staff is clueless and rude , the food is expired , and they do n't have anything put out on display as they should .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
extremely disrespectful workers is one description my family and i came here from after a friend referred this thai restaurant to us . the food took a long time for arrival , and and was cold .
room ok but hard to find . they have no maps to find your way around . they add resort fee of $ 8.50 per day on top of cost of room , taxes , and other fees . resort fee is payable when you check out .
do not get this home warranty company . they are very rude when calling in a claim and they do not get back to you when there 's an issue . they use the crappiest companies to send out to your home and they do not care .
this place is absolute shit and they defend their absurdly high tourist prices because of their facility , which is also complete shit by the way . stay away from here and go buy a fucking ipad instead of shooting their disgustingly priced guns .
really disappointed in the experience i had tonight . i come here often and happened to be driving by with a car full of people . it was 11:55 pm , was not sure if they were open , but the open neon sign was on .
now you ask why american businesses are more successful ? because they 're far more customer oriented to their clients .
horrible . loud unruly guests . walls so thin you hear the obnoxious music they pipe in 24 7 . no coffee maker in the room for 300 a night ? really ?
we ordered 6 plates and i loved one . .not a great batting percentage . whats worse was it was freezing . it 's so cold ! i felt that the ac was on or there was a portal to the north pole open ; cant decide .
terrible . tried to have lunch there today and the ac does n't work well . was so bloody hot we had to give up and leave within three mins of sitting there .
this is one of the worst bbq places in chagrin the service was horrible all of the burgers where over cooked and the restrooms where repulsive with poop all over the seat no toilet paper
i would n't come to this location again , we received such horrible service . their speed and quality of service was trash . if i could give them zero stars i would .
i ca n't believe this estate sale company is still in business . i have visited several of their sales to give them a second , third , etc chance thinking maybe the owners were difficult .
the sessions itself has been really fast and painless but have had no results after over $ 600 in hair removal . i have been very disappointed with the scheduling . they are always rescheduling your appointment last minute .
i rented a car , and the vehicle was fine , however when i received my credit card statement , i was overcharged $ 60 .
i 've visited this buffet 3 times since its first opening , when it opens , the food was made fresh . when we came back the second and third time , the food looked soggy and dry .
the front desk is rude . my appointment time was not honored and they expected me to wait over an hour . i ca n't say enough bad things about this doctors office . and it looks like you 'll catch something in the waiting room .
very bad service . i was promised my guns in two days . after a week i was still waiting . customer service is poor at best . i needed to call and ask about the status of my order .
made the mistake of making an appointment with this place . if you 're at the point where you need a transplant and or surgery ( lasik ) this may be the place for you !
worst barrows that i have ever been to . service sucked . pizza slices were smaller than any other barrows i 've been to . me and my 10 year old son went in for lunch and he wanted a slice of cheese pizza .
i went through the drive thru . the temperature and texture of the fries you could tell they were extremely old . and i had to wait 5 minutes to get them .
girl that works friday evening is a fucking savage . i 've been given stitches without anesthesia less painful than her thread job . this c made me cry . i specifically told her that i like my eyebrows thick and what does she do ?
this arby 's is conveniently located near the corner of woodlawn and south boulevard , so i stop occasionally on the way home when i 've had to work late .
i have never had a worse experience ; from a 2 1 2 hour wait in his waiting room to being on hold one hour on the phone while trying to schedule an appointment . i actually had to drive to the office to cancel to cancel the appointment .
went there on july 24 , 2017 . opens at 5:00pm and we were there just after . all food i tried was just lukewarm . some dishes ( shepherds pie ) . we 're not even put out . told it was still in the oven .
never go here . i came in with very painful stomach cramps and urinating blood . i had to wait an hour , while others got their school physicals done ahead of me . when the doctor finally saw me , he misdiagnosed me with a mystery '' illness .
to steal from another , this place is so hit or miss . if they are the slightest bit busy go elsewhere . my sons daycare is very close to this location and i stop to grab something a lot and the wifi is good .
very disappointed , we found this place on groupon and had a party of six . we made reservation explaining that we had two different coupons .
the people who work here are very rude and mean . once you paid your money , they treat you like trash . they do n't even want to talk to you !
servers get orders wrong , had to ask numerous times what everyone 's order was . ( every one who was standing in line . ) oh , and the butter chicken combo '' is rice with four small pieces of chicken .
i guess being spoiled in growing up with good pizza most of my life most pizza places fall short , police station is another on the list while the price is good per cut why do pizza places think raw uncooked cheese is what people want on their pizza ?
probably one of the worse filibertos in the area ! 15 mins and still waiting for one order . managment needs to step up big time
made an appointment during the phone call the man i was speaking to was very rude . came there right on time waited 30 minutes before i decided to leave . not sure why i even made an appointment if they were going to completely ignore it .
if you do n't speak chinese , do n't order here . the waiters are rude and entitled to big tips .
i no longer trust this dealership . basically , i was told i needed a repair and if i did not get it fixed it could overheat my engine and possibly start a fire .
they got rid of craps ! they had a rep as the place for cheap craps and cheap times ! now the nostalgia is gone . :0 ( now just a lame ass dennys and pointless countless penny machines .
i wish i would have read these reviews before i got my cpap machine from them . i had no choices , they picked one for me .
i bought a groupon for them and first they would not fill the order because they were apparently too busy . when they finally got back to me by email they stated that they would deliver by june 11 , 2013 .
this place is ridiculous . we came here twice already and got different answers from receptionist name marie maria etc she needs to make sure that she knows what she 's talking about before confirming any appointments .
they only accept cash ? since when ? food was cold . its mc donald 's i guess that 's expected ? oh and the cashier ca n't count . she short changed me . i think i 'll call corporate . worst mc donald 's ever .
terribly over extracted espresso . this company puts no emphasis on quality espresso '' as they boast . illy is a well respected roaster from italy . my drink was terrible. beyond bitter . the sandwich was cold and tasted stale .
totally unbelievable . a healthcare company charging $ 100 to deliver a part especially being that your traveling and have been a customer for several years . they should do the right thing and deliver it for no charge .
a good location but not so good service . each time i call this branch , nobody or hardly anyone answers the phone !
i thought kimberly adams was one of the best doctors i 've ever had until i got a letter yesterday firing me as her patient . she comes across as smart and interested and for that you overlook the sometimes extremely long wait times .
very rude staff . treated like garbage from the minute i walked in . food may be good but they need to learn how to treat people .
the service is horrible and the staff are unscrupulous avoid this location at all cost they do a terrible job of representing the company
my appointment was at 4:30 , i got there at 4:15 to be on time but she was not there . i waited till 5:05 and she was a no show and did n't pick up her cellphone either . she did n't even call to apologize .
we made two appointments at elite one month early and six days before our appointment we got a message that our appts had been cancelled because they were n't a provider in our network . after calling my insurance i found out that they indeed are a provider .
i thought maybe the reviews were exaggerated and i would give it a try . wrong . i just left and i can completely understand why they have 1 star reviews ! the physicians assistant was rude , unhelpful , and unconcerned .
i 've been sitting in this drive through for nearly 15 minutes . they at first got my order incorrect and then whoever ( a woman ) took my order gave my friend and i attitude when i politely asked her to repeat the order to ensure accuracy .
asked the rep to add insurance to my second line 3 months ago . then right when i need it , turns out he never added the insurance . on top of that he took out my own insurance too !
i ca n't give this anything but 1 star because i never had my order taken in the 38 minutes i was sitting there . the chef was watching the game and who knows what the waitress was doing .
this place is absolutely terrible , especially if you are trying to take the motorcycle driving '' test . they have made so many excuses not to test me and a buddy . tell us to wait for nice days to come test .
the worst service in the world . they make you wait over half an hour for your reservation yet kick you out soon as you finish eating . not to mention how rude the service staff and hosts are on a consistent basis .
the food ( at least the chicken pita ) is fine , and my server was very nice and attentive , but i was n't treated like a valued customer .
be careful of this company .
showed up at 4:45pm in which they close at 6pm . had one guy working who spoke very little english . could n't even get up to say he had no additional help to service us . not a fan of this place .
had to drive to twinsburg location mocha machine is n't working after 5 months . 8 miles round trip . asked for sausage mcmuffin and medium carmel mocha , did n't realized i received a small mocha .
i doubt this place will be in business by 2016 . gyro lacked meat , pita bread stale , sauce was okay . same guy who rings you up and handles your money , will go straight to preparing your food . no gloves , no washing .
this place is horribly inconsistent . you ca n't make an appointment . they change doctors probably monthly .
young lady told me thy did not have my type of bread , told me cause we been busy '' its 3 pm . then she processed to half cut and smash both my footlongs . ended up wth min meat at best .
this place is really close to where i live so i decided to give it a try . it was the worst decision i made in weeks . the food was just gross , i do n't suggest any take out from here .
if only i could give zero stars . ignored at the entrance while no less than three employees made eye contact at us . sat ourselves and ignored some more . saw 5 employees sitting and chatting with eachother in the corner . moved to the bar .
worst customer service ever . lines are long , and the workers do n't even pretend to care . my shipping quotes were also not honored , just bad experiences overall .
i would have left this feedback with the front desk but no one was stationed there when i left this morning . no hot water this morning , that is fully unacceptable for a hotel .
omg ! so sad cathy is gone . apparently she moved to cali and never told me . i was a loyal customer for many years . that hurt to not get the respect . i heard her talking to movers .
have never eaten inside . ordered online for curbside pick up and they had n't even gotten my order at the val vista location - until i pulled up . i placed the order in the morning for a 4 pm pick up .
the apartments looks nice ! but the management is awful . rude ! and they do n't seems to care about their job . i was thinking in rent an apartment in this location but after the treatment i received i wo n't !
i will never order from pizza pizza again . pieces of pizza did n't even have meat i ordered on them . pizza is gross ! i 'll stick with pizza nova if i order from a chain .
we used to love the pizza here . however , recently , they have changed to something . the past several times we got pizza , it was horrible . terrible dough , and something bad about the cheese .
do not stay here ! i had nothing but problems during my stay here . the rooms are gross ! not only is the decor ugly and dated , the rooms are filthy .
terrible service , truly rude . i waited what felt like 10min in the drive thru , i had to say hello '' ! for someone to start taking my order and someone said order when your ready ! with attitude when i waiting for 10min .
not a good restaurant that i recommend for indian or pakistani food . try something else ! you will thank me later .
terrible photo center ! i brought my disposable cameras in two weeks ago to get developed . it was said that they would send it in tomorrow and it would take about 7 days to be ready .
i 've never been a fan of walmart . they always seem disorganized and the folks walking around just rub me the wrong way . well , this was my first visit to a walmart at night since my move to vegas and i will never do it again .
do not eat here . the pancakes were old and cold - just run away
went in for a quick 6:30 am coffee before a meeting . employee was rude , coffee had something in it , toilet was backed up , air hand dryer broken .
terrible office . my husband was a new patient and sat in the office an hour after his appointment time . not one person came to see what he needed , let him know if doctors were running behind . nothing .
i never write reviews . i 'm not gon na say everyone here is terrible but the guy that did my toes was terrible . he clearly seen that the polish was too thick and when he put the top coat it dragged the pink polish with it .
this place is actually the biggest rip off ever ! paid close to $ 9 for three perogies and 5 leafs of lettuce . love the roastery in liberty village but this place sucks ball sacks . so many other better spots in the area to go for lunch .
worst service ever ! i went into this location first time yesterday , i should have known better as soon as i walked in the shop it was really dirty . , beginning with stations .
horrible that 's all i can say . i do n't even want to give them a star but i had to in order to post on this die . have been waiting with a party of 8 for food .
have been to the place over 100 times . went there for iftar ( break our fast ) . the wait was 25 minutes to get seated . i asked the manager to let us order while we waited . she refused .
worst hotel ever ! picture a crack house with a receptionist . parking is located 6 blocks away in the underground of a lovely government subsidized building . pretty sure a homeless man slept in my car .
i have used this storage unit for nearly two years . today was the first time i had to encounter the front office staff beyond the initial signup . the front office person was rude , offensive and out of line .
this is the closest starbucks to my house . i will drive out of my way to avoid this one . they are so unbelievably slow .
wow . super unfriendly staff . i was ignored at the desk while they completed what appeared to be nominal tasks . acted like i was n't there . when i asked for assistance thee female employee was rude and it seemed like i was a distraction .
unprofessional , never organized and very little knowledge of the sports being taught .
the view was nice , rooftop location is unique , but boy was the staff horrible . no one greeted us .
i generally like heinen 's , but not this one . it 's not so much the employees , or the store , but the other shoppers .
1 hour 45 minutes for delivery . unfortunately , i am unable to comment on the quality due to the extremely poor service ( no explanation apology offer to compensate either ) .
i love costco , but this location is the worst . it is a disorganized mess . they have so much stuff crammed into the store , and such poor planning , that it 's impossible to find anything .
after months of dispute with this place . i am still very angry and bitter .
two words . food poisoning . my boyfriend and i came here for dinner , wanting to try a new ( to us ) local spot . i ordered the chicken and waffles , he a cuban sandwich .
terrible service , they forgot so many of my orders for all you can eat . the servers had terrible attitudes . the food was subpar . the all you can eat rolls were noticeably worse than the pay per roll ones as were the bowls of edamame .
just a dump , corporate should really close this place down . much better off going to the staples across the street .
terrible . i was quoted 15 minutes for a delivery of three easy hot sandwiches and calamari .
do n't go here . stay away and tell your fellow pet owners . i never post messages but have to worn people . the owner was very rude and my dog haircut was terrible . she said they trimmed his nails but they did not do it .
worst macy 's i 've ever been to in my entire life . it 's hot and musty in there . no ventilation . poor product offering .
this place is a dump ! stuff was rude , doctor has unnecessary ignorance and was simply clueless to what needed to be done . avoid this place if you can , i simply wasted my money and time . bad and awful overall experience !
awful place . prices are higher than the corner 7-eleven . the workers are unhappy . the manager looked like he had n't showered and he told his employee to break after working two hours .
my husband i went into the restaurant today at 630 . the restaurant was busy , but not overwhelmingly so . while we were standing by the front , two other people were helped .
i picked this place because i wanted a doctor that would actually try to care , you know ? well , first off , the wait is horrendous . absolutely horrendous .
went in there with hopes that we we have another option besides kami ; unfortunately this restaurant does not serve fresh food which is to evident at first bite !
so , went by there this weekend and they have closed and an eviction notice was on the door . guess they never made enough money to pay their rent .
over priced , took 45min to get my bowl of albondigas that was really awful . the bowl was over spiced with chipotle and served 30 minutes too late . very disappointed and was not worth the 50 dollars we spent as a whole .
i highly recommend you avoid using this location . they are extremely unorganized ! they are friendly however only a few attendants know their jobs completely . i have had to use this location for several different things ( p.o .
pathetic car wash . if you want good service , value for your money go to another car wash . they left patches of dirt on the tires , body and on the bumper . even after complaining to the so called manager '' , nothing happened .
horrible customer service . never have had such bad experience . id rather go to the dmv then deal with this hotels staff .
had a horrible experience with this company .
waited an hour and a half for some of the worst rolls and steak teriyaki i have ever had .
quality work and service is not to be expected from a hair salon located inside a walmart . the worker was not able to follow instructions despite showing her my son 's photo of his previous haircut from supercuts .
disorganized and the stylists vary widely by skill set . if you get the right stylist you get a great cut or blow out . i was impressed at the henderson branch at first .
i 've been to many mongolian bbq places all over the country but this was not mongolian bbq . it tasted like a poor excuse for a fajita . none of the sauces '' had the right flavor and even the suggested combinations were terrible .
terrible service , ordered the philly steak sub and it was the worst i 've ever had . bread was bone dry ! go there for drinks and order 2 drinks for yourself because you 'll be waiting a very long time for someone to help .
hotel offers free airport shuttle and shuttle service into downtown pittsburgh , this service is one in the same as they have one van . we waited t the airport for over an hour and a half .
all i needed was new heels and a zipper repair . when i showed up on the day i was told they 'd be done , they only had one of two pairs .
apartment was fine for the short time i lived there pretty outdated for the price you pay but i believe they were updating at the time i lived there .
there was a hardened old lump of cheese on top of my poutine , obviously not fresh , unmelted . horrible customer service .
so , in general , i hate walmart . not all walmarts , just the really awful las vegas type walmart . this is where they get the people of walmart '' from , of this i 'm certain .
i 've used them for years ( and spending thousands over the years ) because of their convenient location . i bought a brand new , luxury car , and took it there . big mistake .
this place has changed so much and sadly not for the better . my nails chip in a day and the condition of the manicure never looks good anymore . the girl who first did my nails has moved on long ago .
i work in the path and i have been to this place several times in the last 7 months . straight up , they have the rudest staff i have every encountered in my life .
i came in when there was like 1 person ahead of me , an it 's now been over an hour wait , their still telling me i have to wait .
pretty sure they placed bugs at my house in attempt to earn my business . i 've always sprayed the perimeter of my home by myself and have never had a pest problem .
the worst noise insulation i have ever experienced in an apartment building ! if you are looking for a quiet and peaceful apartment , this is not the place for you !
horrible . got there early thinking i could browse through magazines or the spa menu , was greeted by a locked door that says walk ins welcome '' .
gyro meat in general is usually pretty tasty . this tasted like bland beef . philly meat was dried out like it was scorched in the microwave . salad dressing tasted like plain oil . this food needs some love .
i like salsarita 's but i have to agree with the others . their customer service is terrible . i went to get the good ol ' quesarito and she never asked me that i wanted my order to go .
stay away ! i signed up and was told that if it did not work out i could cancel within 30 days and they would not hold me to my contract .
i called clean air cab two hours in advance to arrange for a taxi to take my mother to the airport . the guy on the phone took the address , phone number , verified everything . very simple . well , they never showed up .
room smelled a lot like smoke . everything reeked of cigarettes even though it 's non-smoking . water pressure in the shower was awesome , though . room was freezing and stayed freezing all night even after adjusting the temperature and waiting several hours ( 7 hours. )
it is amazing to me how crowded a restaurant with below average food can be in this town . i 'm giving it one star based on the potential that it may be a decent place to grab a drink .
this place is so disgustingly dirty . the staff was incredibly rude and the food was insanely over priced . there is no excuse for how nasty the staff was . i will never return . not much else to say .
this was disgusting ! should be no star option ! everything comes covered in thick gooey slime that tastes like orange chicken . i order general tso to be brought what looked and tasted like orange chicken .
they can take a reservation but they do n't know how to hold a reservation . i can literally see my mechanic playing on his phone instead of working on my car .
i 'm so disappointed in this place since new management took over ! they are rude and not caring we 've told them that the people upstairs are jumping all day ! it sounds like they are going to fall through the floor .
jiffy ? i do n't think so . 75 mins before my truck was in the bay , and i was the next in line the whole time . please hire mechanic professionals , not sales reps .
so bad . we are muslims and we came here and ordered cesar salad without pork . then they brought it and we asked if there was pork and said no . we started eating and then while eating we found out that there is pork inside .
lazy office manager . did n't want to take 30 seconds of her time to verify a do not copy key was ok to copy . not worth doing business with that kind of attitude .
visited here for the first time , had a horrific experience . wanted a relaxing massage and got pulled on ( therapist called his technique muscle strengthen technique . i explained that was not what i wanted and was told that was what i purchased . totally untrue .
this is about the eye care center . i am so disgusted with the latest commercial on tv about the eye care guarantee .
came in to this place after driving around looking for a bakery for my daughter 's bday cake . we wanted to do something a little more special and tastier than supermarket quality .
after eating hear many times 3 out 5 times i get sick , but , this time got so sick before thanksgiving i ended up in the er .
this place is a complete rip off . you go to sell them something and they offer you a ridiculously low amount , only to turn around and jack up the price close to the retail new price .
forgot my mac and cheese in my to go order . seemed more interested in talking with off duty employee and his friends than helping customers .
i would like to recommend you do not go at all . this place is a small room i believe self owned business . i have been getting deep tissue massages for the last 10 years . for the 1st time i left a massage with bruises .
i have been three times to try to take out a pita sandwich . all three times they were out of pita . so all three times i had to leave . i think pita is a simple request .
not a fan . first , let 's start with the fact that they watch over you as you choose your food and then stare at you while you eat it . so uncomfortable .
while ice cream might be delicious , service was horrendous . we tried ordering child creations '' in a waffle bowl ( for kids 12 and under ) , and the girl kept on saying but it 's a tiny scoop of ice cream .
they closed early and lied and told me they were all out of frozen yogurt even though the guy in front of my got plenty and then told me that if i complained to her manager 'it ai n't gon na do nothing ' .
clubbing , not dinner experience . went with some well dressed friends to join a birthday happening inside . was denied entry because we did n't bring any girls '' , and refused to look at guest list to find the party and let us in .
going out of business ! ( just google it ) i have had previous experiences here - good food , ok disappointing service . went a few weeks ago for lunch - menu is pretty much 8 items now .
food was okay . the girl that looks like a budget jasmine made a rather inappropriate comment about who paid .
i just found a big ass bug in my 4 piece tender ! do n't eat here this place and people who work there are disgusting !
this place needs an update badly . worn out scuffed up chairs . wall paper pealing off the walls . a staff member ran into a door 4 times with a wheel chair adding to the already scuffed up appearance . poor lighting .
extremely disappointed after having dinner at moon doo . started off with some wonton soup - i have no idea what was wrong with the ( pork ? ) meat that was in this soup . it tasted awful !
ca n't expect much , i mean it is a fast food place . only can recommend that if you 'd like to keep your money flow coming in , is to have the workers fix their attitudes .
this place is misleading people into thinking it serves indian food . it almost tasted like chicken cubes cooked in a store bought sauce and the chicken kebabs were like an americanized version of sausage mixed with bell peppers and onions .
food is great . customer service lousy . told two separate people that took our order , to add bbq sauce . get all the at home you guessed it no bbq sauce . called back to let them know . got a rude woman on phone .
i called to get information about an appointment . after asking a few questions about why they only seen recent motor vehicle accident patients , the receptionist got annoyed and actually hung up on me . i 'm not one to write negative reviews but , seriously ?
this place is so so , the actually salon is very nice located in a good area . the slight increase in price was not worth the actual nails . i went in and got a pedicure and full set .
kelly was recomended to me , was busy and got a pregnant lady instead , she was very rude , careless and had a very bad attitude , gave her only a $ 2 tip and she rolled her eyes lol !
do not bring your pet here . not only are they super unprofessional but they try and charge you whenever they can .
i have always loved this ali baba , but had a bad experience today that i feel i should share . i went to the washroom to wash my hands before i ate , and there was no soap or paper towel .
paid more then i expected , my nails and toes were okay not the best job done . one of the ladies were very rude when i asked for another coat in my nails . just upset that i paid more then i expected .
the drive thru service at this location is ridiculous . took a while till they asked us for our order. they waited for the person in front of us to get her order before attending us .
good news ! i spoke to the judge and she agreed to reduce the violation on your citation to a non-moving violation ( 0 points ) , no traffic school .
pathetic service . took them 2 days to submit my work order then tell me it 's 3-5 days for parts .
ordered a party tray of a variety of subs from here for a christmas eve gathering . the bread was hard , very dry. not fresh at all . very disappointed , they hardly got eaten .
i called because i had a malfunctioning pump and they told me that if i buy a brand new pump they come immediately otherwise i will have to wait 10 days . with 120 degrees outside i call this poor service , better an extortion .
worst mexican food i 've ever had . the super nachos were aweful ! skip this place .
if i could give no stars i would . every time i have been in the store , the owner is very rude . she is very snappy . i have gone back a few times thinking to myself , everyone has a bad day maybe that was hers .
the food was okay nothing super special . if you want overpriced average seafood this might be your type of place . the service is even worse the waiter was too high to remember half of food , and the fact i told him it was it husbands birthday .
thursday night 6 pm . terribly slow service . we were just forgotten . with a small hungry child i had to go chasing down a piece of bread . the food was so , so and only served after an interminable long wait .
the gm owner is a rip off artist and also talked about claiming bankruptcy to leave the business . the finance guy also loves charging people for an optional window etching of $ 299 which is illegal . say no ! bad dealership !
recommendations 1 . do not eat the take out sushi ( the rice feels like it 's been sitting there for 1+ days . it was hard and chewy ) 2 . do not eat any sushi with eel ( the quality of the eel was terrible .
thought i would give this place a second chance and it was disappointing to say the least . i had meat jun and kalbi . the meat jun was soggy and flavorless like it was yesterday 's leftovers and the kalbi was chewy undercooked and salty .
worst experience i 've had with a business . you would think reserving a car a week in advance would have a car waiting for you at the place you made the reservation for . well you would be very wrong .
we went here to grab a burger and a beer . service was non existent and when the bartender did greet us she acted as if she was doing us a favor . we went about 9:30pm this passed friday .
i stopped in here on saturday , with one of their delivery tickets . the man behind the counter did n't even bother to scan it , and then told me that ups had already picked up the package - return to sender .
terrible service ! unfortunately , i was never able to try the food . my fiancée and i sat at the bar to order some drinks and somethings to go . the bartender looked at us and said i will be right with you .
poor service and incompetent staff . the staff could n't would n't answer our questions properly .
its unfortunate that just because this dollar tree is in south phoenix they do n't keep it looking clean . it seems they are short staff because they always have a mess everywhere .
this place is run by a bunch of high school kids , attention to details is poor . and they have bad attitudes .
insanely slow service . for as long as it takes for them to get an order of 2 drinks ready , you 'd expect them to be correct .
this place is a joke . the girls that were handling the cover would n't give me my money back from being in that place for only 1 min . they were n't apologetic at all . on top of that , no one was in there .
just do n't come here . they are soooooooo slow . the food is mediocre but it took them 45 mins to make spicy salmon roll . the place was n't even half full . terrible .
first time trying this place and i 'm not happy with somethings with customer service and my nails .
rude to people with disabilities and unhelpful . they make you feel beneath them . will never go again or recommend . negative stars .
this place has the worst customer service i have ever experienced . i did n't like the pho so as soon as i took a bite i sent it back and told them i did n't like it .
worst bagel ever had . the person at the counter did n't know what scallion cream cheese was . they did n't cut the bagel in half when they served it to me .
i went here with the full knowledge that this place would be awful . but the stuff looked so good in photos that i could n't resist trying it anyway . glad i went because i know i wo n't be going back !
went in a week ago ordered 2 small philly cheesesteaks . when the sandwiches came out , the fellow behind the cash rang up the order and that 's when we saw that they made up mediums instead of smalls . could n't believe what happened next .
i 'm not usually one to slam establishments , but i have to here . our mothers went there for brunch today and were eventually asked to leave because their 90 minutes was up . they were even told they had to take their desserts to go .
it 's usually my favorite spot . but the older bartender is a hag for no reason . very rude and disrespectful .
shame i ca n't give this place a lower review . the management was rude . the toilet in the room did n't stop running . ancient tv 's , and god only knows what dna was left in the room .
this place has awful service . we had to ask for a beer menu which the hostess had trouble locating . hello it 's a tap house . anyway no one came to the table to say we 'll be right with you so we finally walked out .
bought some jeans for my nephew a week ago . i asked if i had gotten the wrong size can i come back and exchange . they said yes . come in today , they said no problem .
the bathrooms were disgusting and there were burn holes everywhere . the walls seemed like they had never been wiped down and in the two rooms we stayed in there were greasy finger prints on every light switch and tv remote .
basic bar food for twice the price of what it should be . could have had a great dinner at any number of local establishments in the area for what we spent for two appetizers . wo n't be back .
pretty mediocre sunday roast . no lamb option . the chicken was immediately forgettable . the beef was over cooked . the potatoes were under cooked . the cabbage was starting to turn .
my mother ordered my baby shower cake last week and drove 40 minutes to pick it up on saturday . it was a baby shower for over 100 people , the cake was very expensive and a full sheet cake .
worst restaurant ever . food was cold . my gyro was flavorless and the meat was dry and the bread fell apart because it was so dry . i would n't even recommend this place for dogs ! worst of the valley .
we got here 5 minutes before closing , and the staff yelled out that they had run out of cookies to everyone who had just arrived . we then saw a staff member grabbing and eating cookies right off the baking sheet behind the counter .
food is really good , but service is the worst . if you 're ordering from the four winds location near york you can forget ordering for delivery , they just make rules up as they go because suddenly apparently you ca n't order combo prices for delivery .
stay away . we have spent a lot of money on software and rhinestone supplies with this company . the first sign there is a problem is when you call for support and they have a salesman help you .
got membership for 4 people just to find out there only 2 ( two ! ) show available in las vegas .
all about the money not about the services . they will try to sell you upscale services that you do n't need .
very over priced and they will charge you for every last piece of sushi you cant eat . terrible service it takes hours to get your food and then half the order doesnt come .
place was old looked dirty so i did n't bother ordering . i value my health so i wo n't eat there
hated it ! there was a red ink like thing on my burger . garbage cans were full . never again . yuck !
i came in and had the worst experience ever . first off the place was scorching hot . i went up to the counter and did n't get any acknowledgement by the worker for 3 minutes .
i vowed not to fly spirit again . nonetheless i decided to give them another chance . the restroom was n't clean . the flight was delayed . do n't even think about a reclining seat . buyer beware !
this is by far the worst studio i 've been to . the owner michelle was rude and unprofessional . i waited by the front desk for 5 mins before she even acknowledged me . very arrogant . beware !
hey everybody ! just in case you 're thinking of going to pancho 's vegan tacos . do n't !
i needed a zipper fixed on a skirt and i was sent here by the people del ray cleaners since they do not do alterations and sunset is in the same plaza . the woman i spoke to told me the skirt would be done the next day .
i bought a living social deal and left multiple messages but he never called me back . you probably should n't run promotions with living social if you ca n't deal with the demand .
i was not happy at all with the service i received from this company . i reserved a slot for my sister and stressed to the owner amber that my sister has long thick hair .
avoid at all costs . driver picked up from the airport and drove me through the infamous tunnel so that the fare is a bit more expensive . driver claimed that it 's because it 'd cost more to take the normal route through the streets due to traffic .
i have to say when we walked in it was not that impressive , and that was the highlight ! it was downhill from there . although the staff was friendly and moderately attentive , the food left much to be desired .
horrible customer service . was overcharged and cashier was annoyed she had to void it . acted frustrated and rude . instead of an apology for being overcharged , i got attitude . will never return .
this is a joke ! pretentious place . they did n't even ask me how i want my stake - just brought it rare . and the door always opens and closes - cold air reminds you every time somebody comes in and out that you live in canada .
not happy with the service at all . went in for a quick snack on lunch and was met by the rudest woman at the front desk who took my order .
very poor service . they were n't very busy but we were ignored while the girl talked to an off the clock worker hanging out near the cash registers .
this is literally the worst filibertos ever . there 's this one broad working there who clearly thinks her time is more valuable than everyone else 's & she 's insanely rude . i 'm legit never eating here again .
this location has gotten really bad . the wash lanes do not open on time for starters . the price has dropped trying to be competitive and the service has entirely disappeared . if you want to be ignored , this is the place to go .
terrible service . do n't go here unless you have twenty minutes to spare waiting in the drive thru . not even a sorry or thank you .
gross . that 's pretty much all i have to say about it . the lo mein was actually chow mein , which seems to have become a trend for charlotte chinese food . the egg roll was dry and i had no clue what was actually inside it .
owner is rude and unprofessional . dresses are overpriced . i found my dress from another authorized dealer for half what she offered it for .
i work around the corner from this hotel and i can tell you for a fact that it houses many local offenders which makes me very nervous .
very slow service considering that they where only serving 4 tables at the time . once we got our food the carne asada was to over cook and the pork had a funky smell .
if i could subtract stars from this place i would . the guy massaging '' me sounded like he was having an asthma attack the entire time . not even mention that fact that he had clearly never given a massage before .
they changed the recipe from what is advertised and did n't tell me about it.i got all the way home with my food and found out my two favorite ingredients are not in the recipe this locations uses .
well , shame on me for not consulting yelp before going here . this place is run down and full of the unwashed . you could hunt for something not disgusting on the buffet , but still not sure if the choices will haunt my bowels later .
if i could i would give zero stars , service sucks and management is as horrible . have not seen much of the waitress and management is dumber than a box of rocks .
submitted an inquiry about catering our wedding . never received a response back . i guess their business is so good they do n't need my money .
i went here for a straight year . but my last visit has convinced me to never go back . i went for a fill in for my acrylics and they have me a person i have never used before .
manager and staff need to realize that all forms of government id are proof of age .
we went to this restaurant because we had a groupon . .big mistake ! food was very disappointing and tasteless . butter chicken sauce was flavorless and the pieces of chicken in it were hard . the saag panner also had very little flavor .
one teller with 7 people in line ? a 20 minute wait while the teller just chats with a customers baby . meanwhile the supervisor is doing everything she can to ignore the line and not get on to help .
omg all i 'm saying is corporate is getting a letter from us ! this is ridiculous ! my husband got the privilege of sitting there getting his hair cut while the girls in there were talking about stripping !
thanks for being rude when you got my order wrong and then just transferring the incorrect cheese from one sandwich to the other instead of putting new cheese on both sandwiches . now my sandwich tastes like an everything bagel .
had a very disappointing encounter . took my car in for a wash after a long rain storm and the car came out of the wash with multiple spots of dirt .
why do the people at walmart here not check id when someone comes to the checkout counter using a debit or credit card ?
almost 2 months later , and i 'm still waiting for this almost $ 2000 refund : had to get visa involved . spare yourself , buy a computer or any other electronic anywhere else but here . 6 23 15 -- finally , finally , got my refund .
the girl that helped me today in the drive thru must be new . worst experience i 've had at this t bell . took way too long to order ( she did n't know what i was ordering ) .
never never allow your vet to send your beloved pet here . the never asked me what my wishes were . i was told they would call me . they just cremated by dog snd delivered her back to my vet with no communication like she was nothing .
wow. this place has the most unprofessional staff ever . so rude ! i would never set foot in here again. i recommend if you would like to be treated well or even welcomed to a store , look somewhere else .
wish i could give a good review too bad i ca n't cause everytime i try to go they 're closed they close waaaay too early i 've tried going maybe three times now and never catch them in time disappointment
high prices for donated products . i was appalled that they wanted a thousand dollars for a beat up set of french doors . i found new ones for a lot less at lowes
i have used this company for years . i have referred many clients to them for years . i took in some screens they made to replace . they did n't put the homes in so that i can hang it back up ?
never got a chance or got an offer to meet with the attorney just the legal aid sale rep. was never explained what to expect . would not give updates or answer emails . would not do a full refund even though no work was done .
i waited over ten days and four messages left with no return calls just to fill an rx . i then went to the office and waited almost an hour to get new scripts . the office staff is very difficult to work with and appears unorganized .
do not go here ! they discriminate . friends of mine were turned away with no help because of the fact that they are a same sex couple . what century do we live in again ! do not support this business .
i just finished my massage here and am highly dissatisfied . the person who administered my massage arrived late and was playing on her phone for half the massage and would occasionally stop to text .
when it comes to battery service with aaa , i have a feeling that its more of a lets sell a battery '' type of service versus a lets help this member out '' type of service and here is why .
service was terrible . food did not come out the way it should have . eggs undercooked and mush , bacon not crispy . they ran out of food for our order but did n't tell us until way after we had ordered .
the worst spray tan i have ever gotten . when i made the appointment , they never gave me any tips or instructions on how to prep my skin before the tan .
in a word , unprofessional . the people behind the receptionist desk were chomping on candy bars and acted like i was inconveniencing them with my presence . i was there for a pull on leg brace and waited for over thirty minutes .
this place is horrible . my wife scheduled an appointment for us here . we know that she did . we arrived on time only to have them tell us there was no appointment scheduled .
this is the worst residential company we have ever rented from . they do n't get back to you when you need maintenance done , they expect you to pay for your own maintenance ; they do n't fix anything . they charge you for undisclosed things .
i found noelle through groupon and loved her style of photography . i bought the groupon and immediately tried to schedule with her . after 5 tries with no response i contacted groupon to complain and they must have emailed her as i finally got a response from noelle .
bad review because i paid $ 240 to get rid of some roaches . i was n't even invested with them and your company guaranteed to get rid of them for good . still waiting on that promise .
i got a coffee from here last summer , a younger guy served me and the coffee was so bad i threw it out , i went once before and the coffee was still not that great so i have n't gone back
emailed . no response . both phone s on website constantly busy . argh !
this place is over priced and nasty ! i got food poising from a burger . this did n't happen just once but twice . do not eat here !
can we go into the negative stars . the service or lack of is pretty sub-par . no sense of customer service the gentleman that i had the misfortune of dealing with in the lobby gave me that finger gesture to come to him . ''
do n't know how the actual food tastes here because the store decided to close up 30 minutes early . went here because the yelp page said they close at 11 only to see everyone in the back , cleaning up already .
pinkberry , what 's the deal ? twice i 've come to your strip location between the times posted and you 're supposedly closed already ? how about listing your real business hours ?
the presentation by a super energetic guy kept repeating that this is not a scam . someone repeatedly yelling we are not a scam is quite strange if you are a legitimate business .
added a 15 gratuity for bad service for 2 people . each order put in takes 20 min . food was decent but takes way too long !
this place is awful and trashy . i was uncomfortable , the racks are overcrowded and disorganized ( more so than a goodwill ) . some shoes were missing tags and it took the employees 5 minutes to find the price .
waste of time . i received a groupon for two at $ 20 each . i scheduled a slot in the morning . we drove an hour to get there only for them to tell me that i needed to wear long pants and shoes .
had the 6 taco platter friday evening . got 3 different tacos all so bland that we could n't tell the chicken tacos from the fish . ok atmosphere - a band was getting read to play as we were leaving at 9:15 but ca n't comment on them .
avoid ! the shop sold me & installed fenders that were way too small for my wheel size . they handed me the bike as finished '' with the tires rubbing against both the fenders and a bolt they used to install !
paid $ 45 for dinner and dessert . eat dinner , paid our bill and requested our dessert . waited 15 minutes , no dessert . went to the clerk to check status on our dessert . she said my apologies . we waited another 15 minutes .
had a coupon for $ 5 off , even though it does n't state it , you can not get your 5 off with the lowes credit card . after spending $ 200 i asked if i could get my $ 5 off back and just do the 5 .
this place is just not very good , there a many places in henderson that offer better service and food .
my boyfriend had gotten in a car accident and was really sore so we came in just as a precautionary . i did the online check in for 8:50 . we arrived at 8:50 and did n't get seen until 10:30 .
seen all the great reviews and decided to give it a try . went in with a friend to get a full set with gel took only a few minutes to pick our color and be seated at a station .
waited for over an hour for a cut . while sitting in the lobby waiting 3 barbers left for lunch and did not even acknowledge us by saying someone will be with you shortly or anything .
i have no clue why i ignored the 1 star reviews . why did i think i was special ?
so after i was turned away from the other urgent care location because the doctor was out to lunch , i went to this location . as i walk in the assistant tells me that he 's sorry but there 's no doc on duty today ?
after being a customer for years i do n't think i 'll be coming back . i tried to exchange a bottle of vitamin d because the dispenser was broken and it was impossible !
the only reason i came here was because i was in the area and needed a brow wax asap . i waited an hour ! just for my brows !
i am placing this review here because ladies and gentlemen salon and spa owns brown aveda school . a am appalled on how i , a long time customer was treated today .
staff is rude and there is way too much stuff in the store . not good as a place to consign either . i 'm surprised they are still open .
unfriendly . ugh . too bad . i had cash to spend .
my daughter and i were there last night . the service was good , food just average . the reason i gave them one star is because we both spent the night in the bathroom with stomach issues . we are both otherwise healthy .
i can not comment on their work because i was never contacted back . i left a voice message a couple of times and texted , but no one ever returned my call or text inspite of calling and leaving messages multiple times .
the last two orders were unacceptable . the food was burnt , the pizza was dry , edges were also burnt . i have no choice but to find a more consistent and better pizza establishment .
warm beer , cold hamburger and old stale buns . save your money . a real big disappointment
cockroaches crawling up the inside window . staff did little to acknowledge this until i screamed in front of everyone inside during lunch . manager said it was a water bug . ya right , honey . thanks for the expired appetizer card .
i just moved to the area so this was the closest one to me . this is the worst wal-mart ever ! they had three cash registers open at night for 30+ customers . it took us fifteen minutes to go through express .
this place is a complete let down . the service is poor and very unprofessional . the wait is ridiculous . i tried to give the place a second chance and that went to hell . do n't eat at this location .
im sorry but the kj ( karaoke jockey ) sucks . he puts people who pays more in front of paid customers . wtf ? he said himself that whoever pays more gets to sing 1st .
this is by far one of the rudest post offices and laziest i 've been to in cleveland . ca n't buy stamps unless they are open where most place have technology from 2014 . by the way their credit card machine never works so bring cash ,
have tried to give them a second and third chance . they do not clean the car well , even with a full detail . ( the manager shook his head when i asked him to look inside of the car ) .
they did n't use any anchovies broth just water . bean sprouts are under cook so it has raw bean taste .
i live nearby and shop here frequently , spending some not insignificant money at this place because it is convenient , not overpriced and fairly well-stocked for a hole in the wall . at a store this small , customer service is n't a priority .
extremely poor communication between store and their drivers . i called 2 times to give them specific instructions to not call the recipient , and to call the person who purchased the flowers , if the recipient was not home .
i 'm not sure what happened to this place . my husband and i went there for lunch today because we had eaten there last year and it was fantastic .
now here is the perfect trap for someone who is bored in the palms casino . do n't make the same mistake i did . this yogurt is crap .
so disappointed ! this was my first visit to this salon . i got a gel manicure with ombré french and it looked beautiful . now , less than a week later , it 's chipping and coming off . my usual salon gel manicures lasts 3 weeks .
great service . great waiting area ! why the 1 star ? 1 star because they sell your information to companies that send you offers for scam extended warranties .
terrible customer service . tried to place a carryout order at this ihop and was put on hold for 15 mins and gave up waiting for a response . if this is any indication on how they treat their customers than i want nothing to do with them .
my room was smoke free yet it reeked of smoke and a horrible smell . the toilet barely flushed , and somehow water kept coming on the floor by the toilet .
first of all , there is this one employee there that i ca n't believe they have n't fired her yet . you have to ask her for a box even though you just purchased 5 or 6 bottles of liquor totalling $ 200 or more . ya think ?
used to love this place but the new owner is horrible . purchased take out and the owner was extremely rude . he would n't give any extra soy sauce , over charged on every item .
i used to frequent this place like 2 or 3 times a week . then one night i call up and it rang for 2 minutes . no one picked up . i hang up and call back .
this company is clueless and especially the lady on the phone that answers the calls . repair guy comes out , barely diagnosis the problem and says that the part cant be ordered without investigating it any further .
extremely boring , tacky music choice , rude staff . makes me miss my usual hookah bar in california . if you are so inclined as to go , do n't take josh 's recommendations on the best flavors . so gross .
from what everyone 's said , i would have to imagine that the store ( if you live in cleveland ) is amazing . if you can walk in there and buy something , more power to you .
walked into this store hoping to purchase a television . the salesperson acted as if he was bored . knew nothing about product . did n't seem to want to sell me a tv . i actually drove to target a purchased a tv instead .
just had sunday brunch . very disappointing . for $ 16.95 a person i would expect more of a selection and the food to be hot ! the choices for the omelettes were sparse .
if there was an option for no stars i would choose it . the entire place smells like sewer gas . the owner was aware of the ongoing smell but apparently did n't really care about it when i spoke to him .
this store has a wonderful selection , but they need to focus on customer service . left empty handed even after we found a dress .
i had high expectations for burgr since it is a gordon ramsey restaurant and i love burgers . service was great , i had a party of 9 and they sat us right away which i thought was amazing .
i 'm staying at a nearby hotel . i did n't get any garlic dipping sauce and the driver had no cheese or peppers to give me . had a limp pepper in the box and some weird price of pepper . wo n't order again .
i 'm usually a fan of this tea shop 168 and i have been visiting this location on and off for the past year , mainly because of its convenient location and the ambiance ( just the right amount of white noise and sunlight ) .
three times now we have gone in and have been charged for work we did n't come in for . a smashed battery on a 2 yr old car with no start issues .
i do n't know what happened . but i have been going here for the past 2 years . it 's very close and convenient . somehow th still do n't recognize me or remember my name .
horrible customer service . actually , no customer service at all ! they do n't answer their phones when trying to reach a store operator . then their system automatically sends the call to an on duty shift manager who 's voice mailbox is full . way to go !
this place should be made into a parking lot . i 'm sorry but the food is just a write off here . let me start with my main concern first . we found a 3 inch wire inside our food ! wtf !
i bought a livingsocial deal for eyebrow threading . i have gotten my eyebrows threaded many , many times before but this is the worst experience i have ever had . she pressed the string down really hard on my nose several times while she was shaping my eyebrows .
the worst receptionist . she is super rude and condescending for absolutely no reason at all .
hondas are great ! tempe honda stinks . they have messed with me and my car twice and i vow never again . i did a major service , paid them $ 800 and they did n't turn the service light off .
this walmart is the closet to me , but i still would rather drive 10 mins further to shop at a different location . i only come here if i absolutely have to .
do not go to this pandora . the manager , alyssa is very rude and will not give you the time of day unless it 's putting money in her pocket .
i sat in the drive through literally for 30 minutes ! it took them at least 5 minutes to ask me what i wanted once i got to the speaker and then when i finally got to the window i waited another 5-10 minute to just get my food !
we were hopeful this place would be as good as the ambiance . the food was mediocre at best and the wait was ridiculous . our drinks would sit empty for at least 15min .
i came here for lunch for the first time and can say i wo n't be coming back anytime soon . the food was just ok and the portions were noticeably smaller than other bbq joints in the charlotte .
no no no ! save your time and money and go right across the street to direct . prices at hollywood are too high for the cheap products they are .
i was looking for a nails salon in the area and reviews brought me there to be fair yes they are friendly and there 's no hard smell but my french manicure was a disaster .
flavours are pretty bad nowadays . the place is also a complete trash dump . yogurt is everywhere and toppings can be found in other toppings and we 'll ask in the counter and ground . trash is everywhere inside the store and outside the store .
we went on our anniversary , but did n't know if it was open or not because all the lights were off inside . it was in fact open , but the first 4 things i asked for on the menu they were out of . ''
we came here on a gift card , thank god ! the food is terrible , as if they are trying to cut costs with cheap product . service is good , food is a mess .
wow , seems i should 've read reviews first ! all of the food in this food court was pretty unappealing so we gave it a shot . 3 meats and much of it all tasted the same . ended up throwing out most of the container .
terrible hair weave quality ! the salon could not tell me the type of hair they use on me as they purchase in bulk '' . i had my hair done a couple of weeks ago .
i love buca , its our go to for family and friends dinner but this location it took more than an hour to get our dinner served . maybe the server is swamped but its at 5 the dinner rush has not even started yet.
if you come here to just drink beer , it 's fine . but if you want some food to go along with your beer , go somewhere else . the food is mediocre at best .
l went there today after shopping at sherway . after the waiter sat me down , he forgot about me . before l left in frustration l watched him take a 5 dollar bill out of the tip jar and put it in his pocket .
the only reason i went to this location is because they where the the store that had it in stock . what a crappie location . only two employees they kept saying they where short staff to everyone that walked through the door .
horrible service . food being thrown in the kitchen . order was wrong . no pepper . bad attitudes from employees . fails on all counts . avoid if you can .
had issues w car i rented from other location . talked to garret there . in my view , customer experience was really bad .
would give them a zero star if it was possible . the service was horrendous . the waitress was extremely rude and complained about being understaffed to us , then she continued to be rude about our own complaints regarding the food .
attn ; mgm employees . if you have direct care , this place will not tell you that you are not in their network . but they will gladly take your business and send you a nice fat bill . horrible customer service to not tell you this .
horrible wait times . i checked in at 2:30 with only 2 people ahead of me , and i did n't see the doctor till 4:30 . i was in with him for maybe 10 minutes , so it was a complete waste of my valuable time .
we were not greeted during the 5 minutes that we browsed the store while the salesmen were on their cellphones behind the counter , so we walked out . prices of safes 'on sale ' were outrageous .
i have heard so many fantastic things about julio 's too , so i was really excited to try it today . i was so disappointed though ! i ordered the lunch special k which was a tasteless green corn tamale with rice and beans .
if there was a way to give 0 stars i would . took a best buddy out for his bachelor party yesterday .
this place is pretty terrible . the service is completely inconsistent and the burgers are mediocre at best , especially considering the asking price ! their $ 4 side salad '' is an abysmal , insulting joke .
always long lines and generally one person running things . just waited 10 min . for a drink .
this place is garbage , do not waste your energy time looking at place keep driving and searching !
very rude female behind the counter . multiple violations of hipaa and the fire code . this place is a joke .
just purchased a light bulb , came home and the bulb is bad . what a waste of money and time .
what a disappointment that hilton calls this one of their hotels .
worst effing service ever ! sat down before 2 other parties right next to us . they were greeted and had their drinks and food ordered within a couple minutes .
first time here and it will be the last time . i ask for a glass of water and got a glass of warm water . i ask a second time for a glass of cold water and still it had no ice cubes in and was still warm .
when i arrived there were two large parties and two others in front of me . i waited 10 minutes for the host to even acknowledge i had walked in the door , and take down our name .
the worst sephora ever they are never in stock and they do n't even know their products . if i could rate them a zero i would .
nice place but the dr. is a bitch . she 's all about the money , not to heal people . the visits get shorter and shorter after she gets your money .
i 'm laughing while i 'm writing this because this was the worst drive thru customer service i ever experienced so rude , i would n't even give it one star .
zero . normally i love steak and shake . now i 'll never go back .
this is your typical asian fusion restaurant perverted by the white man for their liking . in my honest opinion , not many restaurants ever pull off a fusion restaurant , and this one is no exception .
this was awful . went there on a friday night and ordered a daiquiri , expecting alcohol in it . definitely did not have alcohol in it , so they had to bring it back and make it again , this time i think it had alcohol in it .
they got a one star from me because not only did they mess up my order . but when they fixed it finally the other three people i was with were more than half done with their meal ! terrible service ! in my opinion . stay away .
never left walmart feeling so aggravated after a shopping trip here before .
my husband and i went the first day they opened bad , wrong food , wrong check , food not very tasty the only good thing was the chips and salsa .
worst service and food . an embarrassment to the city , made worse by being in market square . they messed our order twice , and tried to overcharge on the bill .
this place is a pit in the sketchy part of town . the first suite '' we checked into had hair on the bed and all over the bathroom floor . they moved us into another room that had a filthy toilet .
it was too bad that ownership has been changed . this place was used be affordable place for cash paid patient but not anymore .
such a disappointment . for the prices , i do n't want to eat on plastic plates and drink expensive wine out of plastic glasses . my husband got a steam burn when the dim sum waitress dashed by at top speed .
horrible horrible horrible customer service , when my 10,000 ring comes in from a repair it 'd be nice to get a call to let me know i can come in and get it .
this mcdonalds did not properly prepare my friend 's meal . they forgot to get their sauce . it took them 20 minutes to make a simple meal when it usually only takes 5 mins , with the minimum amount workers required .
disclaimer i had a pulled pork brisket sandwich from a catering truck at an event . cost was $ 7 and included a side . the smell from the truck was fantastic and i was starving , so i could n't wait to dig in .
room sucked . only one clerk at check in . bed was like sleeping on springs . huge wet spot in floor next to other room . creepy pictures on walls . we were staying two nights .
very disappointed in my meal today . my bacon was undercook when i asked to make ur crispy it came back as if it was deep fried so greasy . the strawberries on my pancake had a weird taste that made the entire meal unpleasant .
this is the most frustrating doctors office i have ever been to in my entire life ! ridiculously long waits , ca n't make an advance appointment , getting information is a chore , thumbs down ! way down !
this particular panda express has steadily gotten worse each and every time i go there . after today , i wo n't be returning there and may not any other panda locations . this place is a complete joke in management and customer service .
2 22 17 .
very disappointed with everything the establishment had to offer . ordered the brisket sandwich - what came out 30minutes later was something that carried an old recycled texture from the night before - nothing resembled a bbq sandwich .
my wife went there no creativity , un willing to give you the designs you want and pay for . the owner told me to draw my own design and he will paint it .
drunk or not , the service is terrible . the attitude of chinatown without the price or the authenticity or flavor . you 'd do better at raffles since the wait would be just as long but at least it 's a comfortable setting .
my girl jen is being too nice to this place .
do n't ever come here !
tried the curry chicken with roti . they charged extra for roti but it was a good roti . however the chicken has white pieces in it . i do n't recommend it . tried black peppered beef kay teow . it was burnt no good .
this starbucks is the worst . there can be no one in line with three employees working and it still takes at least 10 minutes to make one drink ! they talk more with each other than they work . i wish there was a location closer .
terrible . my old upstairs neighbor used to dance here . she had a huge arm tat that read only god can judge me '' with a giant cross in the middle . this is about the only good thing i can say about fox 's den .
if your open sign is on , it 's twenty minutes until your posted closing time , and all the lights are on , do n't look at me like i 'm an idiot for wanting to place an order .
this place could be way more successful if it was ran with good customer service and fair menu prices , i mean come on now your 12 $ ruben does n't come with a side . ownership it 's to blame for this failing restaurant .
spent $ 35 on the top of the line wash . they did n't bother vacuuming the trunk , did a terrible job in the interior , with trash still in door pockets and areas that were obviously not vacuumed .
customer service is not evident at this location . so slow 16 mins to get a coffee and i will add a pix . for those of you who get coffee when you see the pic you will know how long it sat there .
i did n't have the misfortune of moving in here , but i did have the misfortune of scheduling a tour with them for a one-bedroom with an exact move-in date , all of which they were notified with .
i went here to get a mani & pedi . the pedi started out good but the lady skipped a few steps . when she painted my toes she left the paint on my skin and did n't clean it up .
honestly . this is the worst place i have ever lived in my life . crime , crime and more crime . feeling safe '' in one 's home and environment is a necessity for our well being . that need has not ever been met for me here .
very bad service , forgot our meals , for twice , and insisted that was the machine 's problem .
unfortunately i did not have a positive experience here . as a new customer i made an appointment with a level 2 stylist . she was very nice and super welcoming . however she barely cut my hair and the parts she did were so uneven .
this was absolutely disgusting ! after waiting 45 minutes for our country ham steak and eggs and ground beef and eggs to be served , we tossed down our napkins , paid the bill and walked out !
terrible service ! pulling up to order all i can hear are the employees cussing and horsing around .
we have been here for one hour . there is under 20 diners in the restaurant and are still waiting for our dinner . there are 5 of us . finally received luke warm dinner .
perfect place to ruin a saturday night . unfortunately i 've been in this place twice . -it 's famous as a gin place , but they do n't serve martini !
food was very nasty , i took a bite of my general 's chicken and pit it out also order salt and pepper chicken wings did the same thing . what a waste of $ 20 bucks for the food i got .
pizza was delivered in a timely fashion but it was burned and almost inedible . the cheese bread was even just average . i will not be ordering here again .
this place does n't keep appointments or times eff this place . you make appointments for a reason . not to be canceled and then on your next appointment wait 30 minutes . people miss work for your shitty service .
i came here to buy some riding boots for my daughter . there was a sales lady and she was very helpful and cheerful to another white customer . when my daughter asked her for some help , she snapped at my daughter and was very rude .
horrible service , average food . not recommended at all , unless you just want to watch the game which was great !
so i 've had mellow mushroom before and it was pretty good but . tonight was ridiculous !
i will never eat at this location again . yesterday , i ordered a carne asada burrito with no guacamole and 3 rolled tacos - cheese only at the drive through .
overpriced , tourist trap . overpriced for plain everyday food . rude , pushy waitresses . do n't get hustled .
wrote the first review four months ago . did not return except once and the grave stocking manager sonny greeted me warmly and really tried to convince me to return . what is wrong with corporations who come in spend four months here and close .
worst customer service ever . was being helped by an associate when two other customers interrupted . she left us to help them . could n't believe it . complained to manager
worst experience on an airline ever . they charged me $ 150 to change my name from joe to joseph so the ticket would match my passport , citing tsa as the reason i would n't be able to fly otherwise .
the orange beef was indeed the worst dish i had ever gotten in all my years . i felt like clara from the old wendy 's commercials , where 's the beef ? '' the dogs did enjoy it .
well , this is my very first comment on yelp . i went to this location today . everything was usual at the beginning , after i picked the frame , my salesman ( liz ) says i need to wait for empty table to get things done .
fair thee well you probably wo n't be missed but i shall always remember the grease the heat and the other fry cook shedding in the food .
this is by far the worst walgreens pharmacy that i have ever been too . i have had several bad experiences here .
ordered from overnight prints '' recently and paid nearly $ 50 in shipping for my business cards to be delivered next day . they were n't delivered until 2 days later , and it was after 8:00 pm . poor customer service as well .
tried for my forth time and it will be my last ! all the coffee and lattes are horrible , food sucks , customer service sucks . .not pleased !
do n't know how they got any good reviews . the chicken tasted spoiled . all 3 of us that got chicken were sick the next day . after only 1 bit of chicken , i just ate the green curry sauce and rice .
if i could give less than 1 i would . while the girls were pleasant enough , they shaved my pomeranian bald . i asked for a teddy bear cut and they shaved all his hair off . this is my stud dog with a magnificent coat .
oh , well .
horrible experience ! i have had four different doctors in one year and the staff inside of the office changes so fast you have no idea who you will get or not get at every visit .
most beautiful interior and exterior design out of all the louis vuitton 's in the west coast . received very bad customer service from an employee eventhough i was going to make a large purchase . i recommend shopping at either the cesar 's location or fashion center mall .
i came here with some family around 6:30pm . they were a bit busy with their dinner rush . the wait was n't too long but they gave us menus and a piece of paper to write our orders down to speed up the process .
they almost had me at horrible when it came to food quality but their service topped it off . wont be coming to this location again ! arcadia location is much friendlier .
worst internet and tv provider ever ! bunch of liars !
recent renovations have improved the look of the interior of this location - no doubt due to serious competition from the nearby longo 's . ca n't imagine how much revenue hey have lost the last couple of years . unfortunately the staff and management remain the same .
god awful . watched sean kingston lip sync to his own stuff for an hour . drinks were terrible . absolutely would n't go there again .
quality of the home was very disappointing . customer service was even worse . ac broke after 3 yrs had to replace the unit . pipe busted in master bath ( thank goodness for statefarm ) contacted hq and pretty much told me too bad !
do n't waste your time checking in online . of course i did n't know that until after i got here & was told checking in online means nothing & the wait is 2 hours . everyone here moves at a snails pace .
this is definitely the last time we will use this clinic . i should have stopped going when they misdiagnosed my daughter and she ended up in intensive care for a week .
do not use this outfit ! we went today and spent more than 1.5 hours only to have the ortho tell us that my daughter needed to go back to the dentist first . terrible customer service and cavalier with customer 's time . will not be going back .
where do i start . we made a reservation and still had to wait like like 30 minutes because they said they had to clean the van . really how is it not ready . they were also really slow .
i would give 0 stars if i could . worst customer service i have ever had . not even greeted when i came in . no one asked what i needed help with . took forever for a very small job . inefficient and unfriendly .
beware , this place will take advantage of you and upsell the living heck out of anything they can to increase the bill should have known better when i pulled in on a sunny sat morning and i was the only car . i do n't trust the guy
my car was making strange noises and was leaking something from somewhere . after going to a regular car repair place and they could n't find the leak , identify the fluid or or the cause of the noise . i called your mechanic .
this place took an hour to serve us two omelettes . an hour . to cook eggs ! if you see that they have more than three tables to serve do not go in there and order . the food will take far too long !
been here a few times now and every time they have managed to mess up my order and charged me for it . every time i tell them and end up waiting even longer .
went here because we saw the great reviews on bloody mary 's and we were staying at the hotel . worst decision ever . maybe it was our bartender but we got two bloody mary 's that tasted like straight tomato juice no vodka in them .
pretty good looking place , but whoa ! food is mediocre at best , except the one salad with the walnuts and cherries ! caesar salad was so tasteless that i started playing doctor to make it better and then gave up . all of our entrees were uninspiring .
underwhelming , the food was just not good . it was flavorless and lacked passion . the quality was lacking , last time i was there the food was awesome , this time it left a lot to be desired .
tried it once , and found a long nasty hair in my food . will never eat from this place again .
this is by far the worst company i have ever had to deal with . they abuse their power , and have towed my car two times in 5 days , from my own apartment complex that i am a resident at .
ordered a meatball and ricotta . it was 22 $ burnt and one piece had an entire clove of garlic on it . very dissapointed
moes ! why did you leave ? i wanted a tasty burrito and you were gone ! i ca n't believe you left me without saying goodbye , or at least leaving me a note ( and a burrito . )
this place just sucks . the first night we came they said we should come in cause they were open late .
horrible service . 5 employees standing around talking . i 'm waiting patiently for 5 minutes to order . i say , excuse me . girl replies , we are busy . '' seriously ? my $ 5 drink pays your bills .
i'v been sitting in this drive through for 25 minutes . 10 of that waiting to have them take my order . these people are idiots . do n't waste your time
the ice cream is horrible , it tasted so old like the your grand mother keeps in a jar on her coffee table . if you have time drive to little italy it 's worth it , if you do n't adonis is down the street .
we ate here because the line for the buffet at bellagio was too long , and this place had no line at all . prices were very good too , considering this was at bellagio . unfortunately the food and the service was sub-par .
worst service ever ! i see why they barely get business ! they do n't know how to properly make sushi ! not authentic at all ! the worker was annoyed with all the questions and they was n't even business ! will never come back .
this really deserves no stars but the presentation of the food looked it . i ordered a large oxtail dinner . what a waste of money ! the oxtail had know seasoning except for salt . it taste like salt and cooking oil .
45 mins on a wait for a banker ? all bankers are with customers talking about their life stories . one was on the phone acting like she was working until it was her lunch time and got up and dipped . longest wait ever .
be forewarned . security deposits are charged as purchases . rental was dec 31 and our deposit was refunded jan 24 after several calls and emails !
warning ! do not bring your children here !
wow where to begin . we were greeted and seated quickly . the plates that were set on our table was dirty . we asked the waiter for clean dishes and forks .
horrible horrible business . the owner completely screwed over my friend and then was horribly unprofessional to her on the phone . he also had the audacity to pretty much call her a b tch . i wo n't say what he actually said because it was very rude .
i do n't normally leave bad comments unless i am really really upset . i went on a thursday night with a whole bunch of friends .
stopped in during lunch today . my wife works next door , we wanted to have a quick bite here . i came ahead of her , the server gave me a menu and never checked up on me afterwards .
went here one time & the bartender had zero personality . made our experience really boring especially for a friday night , it made sense why there were only 5 people there in the whole restaurant . food was decent , but we will not be returning .
we came in because we got one of those scratch off prize things in the mail . we called first and they told us our prize number guaranteed us one of the grand prizes on the mailer .
i am actually writing this review from my parked car due to the rude or should i say lack of service i received . there were several ladies sitting at a small round table outside the door smoking as i came in .
biggest mistake i ever made . they failed to fix leaks and such and you can see what we lived with if i can upload the pictures . but the cat is the one that ruined the carpet . yeah . right . front office staff is useless .
food : over pricing , taste like what i can make at home and presentation is similar to what you can find in a $ chinese restaurant in orange county .
just yuk . truly . fishy . warm . dark mystery fish . threw half out .
the food is below average and tea is also not that great . what 's even worse is service from this particular lady who is rude . i asked can you make hot tea as hot as possible ? ''
if i could give this store a negative 5 , i would . absolutely terrible service . i ordered a nightstand and it has been six months now and still waiting for it !
worst customer service ! made an order for delivery and they guy that placed the order stated he could n't give me the total and then when delivered it they charged me $ 10 for delivery . $ 30 for food for a teriyaki bowl .
bad coffee , small portions , does n't seem very fresh or healthy with loaded in mayonnaise on the breakfast sandwich .
what 's the point of reserving in advance if they are n't going to honor the reservation ? this is the second time . i ca n't do business this way . i do n't understand how discount cab is able to ! i 'm done .
staff spoke very little english but we 're friendly nonetheless . however , no matter how many times i repeated myself , they could not understand the service i wanted ( neck and back ) .
beautiful restaurant . needs a lot of work to be successful . my wife and i both had pork schnitzel . small portions and over breaded and over cooked . $ 7.50 for a draft beer ? this is not nyc . one star for the ambiance .
a no-show on my wedding day ! the day before my wedding , i attempted to verify call time & location & did n't get a response . it was n't until 2 hrs before the ceremony i was finally able to get a hold of todd wilson .
first time at this location . food was n't very good ; beans were extremely dry and burnt , tortillas were stale . restaurant closes at 11pm , arrived with a party of 13 around 8:45pm and was treated as though we were causing an inconvenience to them .
when you go to this place expect that 75 of your order will be wrong .
although we never had the chance to eat here bases on the customer service we encountered over the phone i gave this place 1 star .
the manager and staff are completely inexperienced . they would not let me return some xmas clothes with receipt because part of there 2 mile register receipt was missing ! omg then they tried to offer me a return for today 's value .
service was whatever , coffee was crap and the bagel was the worst i have ever had ! one positive , was only $ 4.50 so i figured i got what i paid for !
got my nails done there today . my friend and i had booked an appointment however other ppl were coming in and were taken before us. i was really disappointed by the amount of time we had to wait especially when we had appointments booked .
this was the most dirty hotel i have ever stayed at . they have our room away , then gave us a dirty room with hair all over from previous guest . we found a bug in our bed & the toilet was leaking .
friday . extended hours . 1 person catering 20 in queue at cashier . staff lying . 4 people in seated banking section for over 30 mins
one of the worst hotels i stayed in us for such a high price of $ 175 per night . room environment looks like 70 's old model room and furniture . no refrigerator , no proper lights etc
worst service ever . i took to get my ipad fixed for lcd and they took a week to replace , when they told me it would only take 48 hrs at the most .
the drinks we ordered were fine and the food was good , but the service left something to be desired . server kept forgetting '' to refill the water . she walked away several times while one of us was talking to her .
i 'll give nearly any business a second chance , but after two of the worst experiences that i 've ever had , i am done with this location . there are plenty of businesses that want your patronage , unfortunately the landmark us not one of them .
wish i could give no stars . twice i have been approached by some big wig about my emotional support animal even though i got the letter from them telling me i ca n't have my animal in the facility .
if zero stars were an option , this place would be a candidate . absolutely the worst pizza at the most ridiculous prices ever . cafeteria line , overheated , dry , cardboard pizza . institutional , long lines at lunch time and not worth the time or effort .
we were starving after church and stopped here for brunch . got a seat right away at the counter . ordered right away and were served drinks . then we waited . and we waited . and we waited .
this place is terrible ! nothing is homemade , everything is from the freezer . the guys who run this place are pigs , and treat their employees like trash !
hubby has a thing for french dips , so when the flier came in the mail advertising rock bottom 's new firehouse specials , he really wanted to go , especially since we were in the area anyway .
tried using their website , it was not very useful or helpful . i could n't call them either . i was n't happy at all . then i went there and i could get answer i needed to cater for my son 's baby reveal .
this is more like a glorified drop off center . the store is tiny , i mean tiny . this is a waste of space .
the ladies here are so rude , i speak spanish fluently and i went in for lunch and heard them talking shit about the customers in spanish and they clearly looked like they did n't wan na work there .
i am so disappointed in this place . i have ordered from here many , many times and have had nothing but great service . food was really good , on-time , etc .
wo n't ever come back here again . love the way it looks inside , the color selection is amazing and the prices are good . they also do a great eyebrow , and my toes look great , but they re customer service sucked .
worst experience ever . poor hostess service and the manager made us feel that our money was n't good enough to request a slightly better service . the only good moment was with the waitress , she really was nice .
he did n't let us in in the pool because he said we did n't have a room key . we told him we are going to the liquid pool but he still did n't let us in .
got a new lady and it was the worst pedicure ever . looks like i painted my own nails , so i call salon to fix now been sitting here for 45 min watching them take all the new walk-ins : do n't think i 'm coming back .
i purchased an $ 80 bouquet here recently , which pretty much fell apart after i got home .
not clean . do n't go . i got an infection day after on my big toe . i saw the nail tech washing her own feet in one while i was drying my toes .
i had read about moe 's here on yelp . so i thought i would stop by and have a meal . i drove by kyrene and elliot and could n't find the place .
first time we dined here . the experience was terrible . the food took over and hour and a half to begin . medium steaks were thoroughly cooked to brown throughout . the bald owner walked around and viewed the area but never came to apologize or offer anything .
worse place ! i ordered a crispy chicken salad and was told it would take 5 mins , no problem i waited . i then get my salad and the chicken is raw .
if there were negative stars , i would use them ! but they get one for the crew being nice ! took the family there to grab a meal . inside was not busy , cleanliness was so , so .
i went to try the chicken wings here cause i heard they are good . i tried a dry spice for my wings . they ended up having hair on them . the wings are big but for taste i 've had better .
i am devastated . i am having to pay a dentist to salvage my teeth now . i had fillings needed and had been here multiple times for x rays and a few fillings . the pain of the procedure required gas .
a week ago my mother did me the favor of taking my nissan altima for a car wash . instead of getting their basic clean , she went the extra mile and got their best wash .
worst customer service ever ! when you call them to check on your order they put you on hold for ever and then they hang up on you ! this has happened not once but many times !
i was most dissatisfied with the service and cancelled my weekly cleaning after 8 months of multiple problems and poor performance .
these people broke my stud and did n't replace it , citing rust '' that was n't there . and on top of that they recommended i buy wheel locks for every single stud ( when you only need one per tire ) .
demolished our cabinet unnecessarily claiming it was wet when in fact it had no ( zero ) water damage . they returned the cabinet in pieces ( with the wrong pieces at that ) . we are disappointed that this company would do something like this to a customer .
came in prior so knew what i wanted . only location i 've been to where they do n't see if you want help . usually someone is there when you do n't want them haha .
called him ( wayne ) around 3pm to rent a scooter . he told me he stops delivering at 2pm . so he said call him the next morning . so i did . he assured me i was getting a scooter on the phone .
avoid this place . i want to like this place because it 's walking distance from my house but after giving it a try every 6 months or so for the past three years i 've given up . i have received the same poor service each time .
amy j . well she needs a huge attitude adjustment . popping her gum . reaching behind her back to pull up her pants , getting orders without using glove or washing her hands .
went during march madness . skip it , took 15 minutes to get a beer , in the bar ! took 45 mins to get some bad sliders , and another 15 to get ketchup for my fries .
i have enjoyed this place in the past . unfortunately on sunday i had a miserable experience . i asked three times for increased pressure and was literally told no no no '' , it was so light there was zero therapeutic value .
we must be a glutton for punishment . we decided to give them another try on 3 21 14 . once again both pizzas came without wax paper . they were so greasy they had soaked through the box ! the meatlovers had barely any toppings .
extremely disappointed with this store . i went to this location around 10 pm on a saturday and all of the lights were turned off as if the store was completely closed , when their closing time is supposed to be at 12am .
i was so excited to use my groupon today . however , i was very disappointed with my experience . my massage therapist fell asleep while she was rubbing my feet !
they suck they lie about when ur stuff is being delivered and there disrespectful . all the employees care about is commission . run away from this place !
i went in to make an appointment , made the appointment . four days later i showed up on time , i was told by the artist he was almost done with the guy in his chair .
used to love coming here for late night snacks until the day i asked for lettuce on my burger . the answer i received was this is not a salad bar '' .
i hate to give a local business such a bad review -- especially when i had such high hopes for the place , but the food here is awful . i love tacos . i 'm not very picky about my tacos either . but these tacos were flavorless .
wish i could give this no stars because this was the worst massage ever !
extraordinarily bland food : ( for being on mill ave i hoped for better but . it did n't taste authentic at all unfortunately and the enchilada sauce was watery and looked like it had food coloring in it . service was great at least .
i work close to this gas station and i stopped by on my way home to fill up my tank .
$ 6.99 steak & eggs ? i was extremely excited . and you let me down . i think my jaw still hurts from the chewy steak i consumed that night . thank god for a-1 steak sauce .
me and my wife ordered steamed white bass & scallops dishes . both dishes are just bitter , no taste and way over priced . it was unbelievable we spent $ for this crap .
this is the worst paint ball field in the valley . this is the 2nd time i have been to this paint ball field . they over charge by $ 20 for mandatory field paint . on the day i went my group averaged one game per hour .
just do n't go here if you need to get anywhere in a respectable amount of time . i 've been in line 15 minutes and there we 're only 3 people ahead of me . and this is n't the first time either .
waited 30 minutes before being told they have several appointments in front of me . meanwhile the barbers are drinking corona . obviously does n't need my business , even though i 've been coming since i moved to charlotte .
must be a fluke but tonight 's show was lame and the food made me feel like i was flying coach . can not recommend this event for anyone except the in laws .
rude and filthy ! sat down to get a pedicure and wanted to get up immediately after looking around . they started so felt obligated to stay and was planning to get a fill in as well .
i have never experienced the terrible , disgusting service i got from this location . i ordered the thai lettuce wraps to go , and when i got home , found a bug squished between the lettuce .
rudest self-proclaimed professional i 've ever encountered . i do n't know any professional who claims to have never made a mistake in a 37 year career . julie speaks to her clients in the rudest manner when the client questions the numbers on the tax return .
what a bunch of douchebags . i booked an appointment for my dad . when i booked it they said , we 've got slots open right now , he can come right in .
i feel the people office in the chandler office are very unprofessional and not caring ! you have to understand people are coming her for a service , we are paying for a service !
this was my first time and last time at this barber . i was unlucky enough to have t '' cut my hair . he was very rude , unwelcoming and could n't be more off putting .
been here four times total and was never impressed with anything about it food was n't that great service was only ok and when i found wax paper underneath my pizza that 's where i draw the line .
i waited 45 minutes to order . and then proceeded to wait an hour for the food itself to be made . terrible .
i had high hopes for this place . the staff was so friendly but unfortunately the food was terrible . everything about it was horrible : flavor , texture , presentation , etc . the salad was good enough that we ate it after we threw out the pizza .
i hate it when places have 3-4 people greeting you when you walk-in , but only 1-2 tellers helping you at the window . forget the greeter , pay someone to help me with my transaction faster .
bouncers are a-holes . no idea how to enter the place . waited in line in front of the bouncer for over 15 mins and idiot bouncer said that we needed to wait in a different line .
normally they do a great job but lately they have been under staffed and take a long time to get anything done . i know that this is a franchised business and i think the owner may need to get involved .
first time we went , one gentleman was very nice and service was good . i think those days are gone . wait staff is rude , when they have any . we just tried to go and there was one person behind the bar and that was it .
previously , one of our favorite spots until we experienced the culture of the management . as stated on the website , they close at 10pm . we were rushed out at 9 as the staff closed the sushi bar down .
worst possible service in the sports book of any place i 've been to in vegas . literally waited 45 minutes each time we wanted to order a drink . oh and it 's not even crowded .
one word . gross . i am not the pickiest of eaters and even this was way to disgusting for me . the sauce was absolutely horrible . tasted like it had been in a can for years as it had a tinny taste to it .
very disappointing evening . took over an hour to get medium pizza , 8 wings and calzone . the restaurant was not busy at all . when we asked for plates waitress acted surprised .
avoid this place at all cost . save your money and insurance for somewhere else . try clear vision eye centers . this place will charged you a certain amount at time of visit but , then weeks later they will send you an additional bill .
this place is always dead . the restaurant is dirty . the employees are rude . go somewhere else . this place does n't want your business .
although the store may have plenty to offer while waiting for the flight , the staff on the morning of 5 13 14 certainly did not !
being a local of las vegas for 16 years , i was very disappointed in my visit with hustler club tonight . i have been here on several other occasions but my views have definitely changed . the place was very crowded .
poor experience all around . not pleased with the customer service . on two occasions they tried selling my wife services that were not necessary . the wait is always extremely long .
i have tried this place a few different times and am disappointed every single visit . i would n't waste your time . sorry .
this place has decent modern contemporary styles however there service is terrible . i believe warehouse movers took my order , and the order was screwed up with my sofa in one location , when i specifically called ahead to see where it was to pick up the sofa .
i attempted to get my colonoscopy done at valley view surgery center .
our first time there was our last time . my husband and i actually ended up ordering the same thing , the taco burrito combination plate . we should 've known something was up when our food came out extremely fast .
i went to 4 stadiums this year for spring training and this one was the worst .
worst wings i ever had ! i think the wings were frozen then thawed in the microwave . the flesh was tough ! and extremely dry ! $ 3.95 for frozen french fries ? extremely disappointed !
last night a bunch of my friends went to chez serge looking for a good time and a chance to ride the bull before we graduate from university .
this place has the worst customer service and gives out way smaller portion sizes than any other noodles i 've ever been too . today i ordered 3 small buttered noodles and literally had a child 's portion in it compared to the others .
i ordered pizza from this restaurant and they said it would take an hour . i called after an hour and fifteen minutes and they said there was an issue with their oven and it would be another thirty minutes .
extremely rude ! we were there for cinco de mayo , and got on the list . the front was so packed that we decided to go to the back bar and have a few drinks until seated .
we had recently sold our house & looking for a rental home . we had found a listing we were interested in listed by prs .
i stopped by for lunch today and was extremely disappointed . i ordered a taco salad . they had no shredded cheese , no small beverage cups and after i got the order i found out they had no forks !
it is probably the most busy cafe i 've been to and they do n't have change for a $ 100 , after i already ordered and showed her the bill in my hand , as if .
cvs auto signs up for ready refills without permission and fills them when specifically told customer will call when ready for refill as they can be expensive .
this lawyer is a very smooth talker , but once we signed a contract with him he did not return our phone calls and e-mails .
very rude owner & expensive this is the worst service in town , the owner is so rude and has the attitude .
this is a great gym if you like broken equipment . pay the extra couple bucks a month and go with 24 hour fitness .
this was my favorite place to eat a couple of years ago i am not sure what changed but it has changed for the worst ! cold food , two dirty forks in a row that looked like one had old dried up ranch between prongs friggin gross !
the survive is great ( anna ) but the food is terrible . they had to bring me two plates but none of them was great . one was over cooked and the other one is undercooked . honestly that was the worst salmon i ever had .
this was the first dentist i took my 2 year old daughter to .
i got a call from them after giving them my information online because i was sincerely interested in buying a car from there , but as soon as i told the woman they may not have what i want she just hung up on me .
this is the worst fast food '' restaurant in surprise . i have been in the drive thru trapped between 2 cars for 20+ minutes and no one has taken my order . the car ahead of me is literally turned off .
i tried the perogies and salad for lunch . the caesar salad was ok except bacon bits was , i felt , bit weird crunchy tasting and not like bacon . also the perogies were bad .
worst ever experience with them today - i strongly encourage others to stay away from using them . they are crooks and there customer service is terrible !
the worse customers service in the pharmacy ! there is only one nice person in that dept . the rest are the rudest people i 've ever met in my life ! if you do n't need their pharmacy then do n't . if you do .
i 've had my boys playing in this league since 2014 fall season they play fall & spring season love that all games r at the same place every weekend . but the league need to start doing something about these cheating teams we have out there .
my first time here and for some odd reason my sausage muffin sandwich had a foul smell to it and the muffin taste like 3 days old . the bathroom smells so bad too. never again .
i went to this cafe today at 5:50 and ordered a salad . when i opened my bag i saw i didnt get dressing , a fork , or the free cookie they give .
need to remove when a place closes down ! we went arrived at this location only to find it 's not there anymore !
this post office does not even deserve one star , they are the worst !
on my way to work and i get a nail in my tire . small annoyance . normally would fix this myself . but i 'm dressed for work so i figure this time i 'll just pay someone to plug it for me .
this place is a dump , not a dive . a neighborhood dive would be great , this place should be closed down . dirty , rotten wood floors , walls dirty overall filthy . service horrible .
went in for a pedicure and the man cut my toe ! bled for a couple minutes and he tried to put some no name stuff on the wound , and i refused .
horrible horrible horrible do yourself a favor and go to another location all i needed was my picture taken and i was made to wait with everyone else that had issues and problems took hrs just for a picture wtf !
defiantly the worst service you can get in my area . unfortunately it 's the only service i can get at my apartment . at any peak hour your signal is slowed to a near halt .
very rude girls that work in the front . i would rather get a sandwich from the liquor next door . if you 're going to be rolling your eyes at customers then you might as well look for another job , just saying lol .
just awful . the entire plate of food was covered in salty gravy . and i ordered a sandwich . the service was trashy and restaurant needed a scrub .
horrible . tried the new eggs benedict sandwich . has the same factory made taste as all their other products . i 'm done with tims
rude staff , slow service , poor quality food and much much much too expensive . this place is a huge difference from the one in bellevue wa that my boyfriend and i used to eat regularly at .
service 0 5 atmosphere 0 5 food 3.5 5 i 'm truly upset about the whole experience i had at this restaurant . there is another location on dufferin which is not like this one at all . only 2 waitstaff on a busy sunday .
the bed was so uncomfortable you literally felt like you were sleeping on just a box spring . next time i 'll spend the extra $ 15 for a nicer hotel . our bathroom sink did n't even have hot water .
went for winterlicious lunch special on tuesday the 9th . order the jerk chicken sandwich , other parties at my table all order the chicken and waffles . i can say they all enjoyed their meal and the portion was amazing .
this is the worst milestones location we 've been to . the service is terrible , and even the food is not on par with other milestones . we 've been multiple times when they 've ran out of prime rib at 7pm .
i purchased full fare flights from the air canada website and they would n't assign me seats on a flight with plenty of availability leaving in 4 months .
the food here is horrible . i found a hair in my meal and the wait staff acted like i was lying . the service is slow and the whole staff is arrogant . do not eat there .
took 15 minutes for hush puppies and 50 minutes for food . place not even busy . went to the one by mills and food came out 15 mins . and manager brought the food out like he did something . no silverware also .
heard a noise in the engine and went to have it checked . waited a long time before they pulled my van in . i was surprised to see it being pulled out less than 20 mins later .
sprint buyer beware ! when they say there is 14 day return policy , please read the fine print , there is a $ 35 restocking fee , and the phone that you traded in wo n't be returned .
the star is for their beer , their food deserves 0 stars . we ordered an appetizer and 5 mains ( all burgers ) , and all of them were over cooked .
stopped here today for lunch . ordered pizza by the slice . 1 hour later our pizza came , without an apology of the delay of the pizza . it was not crowded at all at the restaurant .
like many other reviewers , i received my order about a month later than i was originally quoted and only updated about when it would get here after i contacted them myself .
went down hill a lot . used to be awesome now not so much . less portions in gyros than before and still the same price . delivered on time but the food was cold . taking my business elsewhere
the food at these shops is terrible . it is like eating airplane food . salty , bland , thoughtless . do yourself a favor , spend your money somewhere that cares a little about quality .
wish i could give less . i can not respect a business that ignores appointments and never answers the phone . i called 8 times and the phone was answered once . the address on the website is incorrect then they blame the customer for being late .
i gave this one star only because i had to , otherwise they would have gotten none . i used a groupon to try it for the first time to see if i liked it .
the tables are disgusting . nobody cleans them even though it is still early in the day . for $ 10 i got two pieces of day old bread , a slice of cheese , a slice of tomato , and basil .
friend of mine lives in these apartments . there are two very thin stray cats living in the complex . my friend and few other residents have been feeding the cats . they are compassionate human beings ! who can walk past something so skinny and not do that ?
do n't come to this location if you have large amounts of cash you are depositing . this is the only location i 've ever had issues with .
long time customer . friend lives right across the street . but i committed the cardinal sin of leaving my car in their empty parking lot for all of 15 minutes while i also went to the shop next door and they were about to tow my car .
i do n't know why i ever go to this starbucks , it 's almost comical at this point that they have never gotten a single one of my orders correct .
went twice since opening . both times ended up with bubble guts . the last trip ( today ) i could n't even make it home . will not be back . and i grew up loving and craving mongolian bbq , but i ca n't stomach this place .
was very disappointed . i ordered carnitas tacos . totally not what i 'm use to being from california but tried it anyway . the meat did n't have much flavor , so i tried adding salsa . no luck .
needed an appointment to have my cat spayed . she was currently in heat , but they were trying to have me bring her in and have it done anyway . that is not good for them . .no thank you .
in response to your reply . we did meet with mackenzie prior to her grooming of frankie . she did not check him for matts and she made no comment about it .
visited a few times prior and was the cleanest most diverse froyo place we had ever been .
worst company ever they randomly charged my account and told me i would have to wait 6 weeks to get the money back. and technicians were supposed to show up on three different occasions and they never came it was four hours out of my day for 3 days.
i used to eat at charley 's for the philly steaks until i tried corleone 's i fell in love with it . until recently i requested mushrooms on my sub so upon eating the philly i noticed they used canned mushrooms !
well , i guess i should 've walk out when i walked in . because when you go to a grill & bar restaurant , you are expecting a full house . if not , then its a warning .
this was the absolute worst so called chinese '' thai '' i have ever had . the quality of the food was very poor and not well tasting at all . the only good thing about it was the price . five meals for $ 45 .
i spent $ 70 on their premium wash . .it took them 2 hours to finish . when they were done , there were water spots on the glass , steaks on the windshield and something brown on the back of my truck .
review is based on the less than friendly front desk staff . i have worked out at la fitness gyms in 3 states going back more than 10 years so i know what to expect . however on this occasion i did n't make it past the front desk .
this is the third or fourth time we have ordered from this location . in colorado papas was my favorite pizza . i paid 27.00 dollars for a large veggie . it arrived luke warm at best .
walked by - was afraid i was gon na get shot . turns out someone did later that night .
my family has purchased several different appliances over the years from b and b . we 've always been pleased and never had any issues , until earlier this week .
avoid this company , they will rip you off ! i had a horrible experience and when i tried to report this i was continuously ignored . they care very little about customer serivce , their prices are high , and their products are average at best .
another friday , another blatant miss by our republic services driver . drove right past us while we were out in the parking lot . called and asked them what the deal was . once again . we 'll escalate , call the route manager . etc .
it took 20 minutes to go through the drive through because they were taking so long . and that was with multiple cars in front of me leaving . meanwhile one of the employees went outside to take a cigarette break .
far cry from the 7th ave location . hot salsa tasted like pickle juice , enchilada , bean and rice absolutely flavorless , and green chile burro , nothing like the original location . never again . one star is for subpar food
very poor service ! i had an appointment and still here after 2 hours ! really come on now it does n't take that long !
do not order online . no tracking system , no cancellation , no returns , takes forever . 4 to 6 weeks for small candle holders ?
unreliable and sometimes aggressive delivery service . food is usually ok , but the mafia vibes some of the delivery people give are unpleasant . even more so because those same vibes are carried on by the managers and employees at the restaurant itself .
horrible service and food ! reservations were made for 12 people , restaurant was short staffed , manager came out to our table on the phone ! food was terrible ! pad thai tasted like plastic . no flavor .
i gave this place three chances over the years and each time i was disappointed so i am officially done ! the latest event : had a slow leak in a tire , called and was told to come on in .
another wasted trip to this sears store . says it 's open til 6 , but yet again it 's closed when i get there . at 4:15 . either stay open til your stated time , or change your posted hours .
normally i 'd give them 3 stars but after last night , not happening . my girlfriend and i both suffered from food poisoning from last night 's chicken .
another victim of jackson construction and remodel . default on settlement agreement and lawsuit against them . beware .
this place is creepy , i do n't know who would party here if it were n't game day . ordered chicken tenders , took 40 mins ( actually that 's a lie , i 'm still sitting here waiting ) bad food , bad service and bad ambiance .
i would only rate this as 1 star . no gluten free options except iceberg lettuce salad
so disappointed . sorry this place is not at all what i was expecting . if you love wine , i would not recommend this place .
had a very bad experience at the gogo lounge .
heard great things about nekter over the weekend and was excited to try it . went in this morning and was disappointed to learn that they do not use organic produce !
so today i bought a lemon berry slushie and there was a fly in it so it would have been great if i could have enjoyed what i paid money for but whatever throw a fly in there thats cool too .
omgosh . .no exclamation points here . the food was tasteless and my friend found the longest piece of hair in her drink ! i got the al forno dish and i asked for mushrooms to be added .
stay away . they are just collecting your contact info and giving it to lenders so you 're getting a lot of junk calls from lenders .
absolutely the worst drive thru service ever in the morning . when the person came on the speaker she was extremely rude . we ordered and waited 25 minutes for the smoothies .
i was wary about going here but now i know not to ever go again . the atmosphere was fun , our waitress was good , but i gave it one star because i got food poisoning from this place .
they charged me $ 9 for some paper chips bec i had some room in my box ! the young man did not tell me he would charge me that much and he did not inform me in advance that i would have to pay more !
nana is the rudest nail tech , i have ever met . i made an appointment drove from the other side of town to do my eyebrows . when i got there she already had someone else in her chair and said to come back in one hour .
oddly enough , it was a negative yelp review that drew me to diamond 's in the first place ( a review i see is no longer on yelp ) .
the food here is not that great any more . the beef short ribs were over cooked , the chicken tastes different , the miso soup was very watery and tasteless . i think they switched owners because i no longer see the familiar waitresses and sushi chefs .
i was really excited to checkout brixx . i had heard some great things about it . we hit the 6th street location . my friends arrived before me and had their beers for 20 minutes .
beer was cold and had great selection . food was mediocre at best , service was good and people friendly . the problem started the next morning on the toilet for two hours . do not eat here .
slum . run do n't walk away from this place . the pool is closes broken almost always . the security gate breaks weekly . you car will get vandalized . mine only got the antenna stolen ( who steals an antenna ? )
dr. b is a great doctor . we only saw her once in the hospital and we liked her . the rest of her staff , not so much .
first time trying their food was by take out . it was really good . we ordered sopes and tacos . second visit , we decided to eat in with family .
the furniture manager is a fool . she heard us say we needed help and ran away . we proceeded to ask another employee to help us ; he said no he would not but eventually called her . she never showed .
if i could give this company a zero star i would . i would never use this business based of principle .
the owner is funny and nice , but the lunch menu was not thai more chinese based .
if there was an option for 0 stars i would have marked that , but instead i have to get them the benefit of having at least one . you ca n't hold anyone accountable for the clothes you dropped off .
good night irene ! i used her in the past and thought her work to be first rate , until recently . my boyfriend and i gave her over a $ 1000 worth of new clothes , mainly pants and other things that needed a simple hem .
awful service . guides did not take groups to the boats and left people confused . when asked they were consistently unreliable regarding wait times and the quality of the boats .
i would give this place a 0 star if this was an option . i went there as this was the only korean hair salon in mississauga . previously , there was an older lady at this salon and she was decent .
ordered online on a busy saturday evening and took us 15 minutes just to find a place to park to pick up the order . they told me on the phone to pick it up in the to go room which is n't labeled from the outside door .
every time i have been to this location i am frustrated and disappointed . the shakes either have too much ice that was n't blended correctly , or rude staff that ca n't remember what you ordered .
no response from 2 people helping one other person for 10 min ! i left and even put my water back . unacceptable !
beware ! just called front office . stove oven not working . told me it 's not an emergency because it 's after hours . six o'clock and i have to feed my family and i ca n't have it looked at until monday ! unbelievable .
i was trying to buy a pair of shoes for my sister 's rehearsal dinner . they only had one pair in my size for the shoe i liked . the problem was , they looked like they had already been worn and returned .
horrible experience with the southwest terminals . they had several tsa employees for one gate and only one security scanner open for a huge line of passengers . the hold up was due to the tsa security just standing around and talking !
it was very badly smelled , staff was very rude . i have ordered food for to-go and initially i was told to wait 25 minutes and then another 10 minutes . i have waited for 45 minutes , and guess what food is still not ready .
yelp users said it was bad and they were spot on ! how do you mess up beef fried rice and spare ribs . pretty basic stuff . my bag smelled like cigarette smoke , the food was luke warm and just gross . the rice was over cooked .
every time i order from this location i end up pissed off . i ordered pizza and pasta and both were cold by the time they got to me .
i placed an order at 6:30pm tonight and just now received it . ( 8:30pm ) now , i could understand if i had ordered for a bunch of people but my order consisted of one medium pepperoni pizza and an order of bread sticks .
bad service , bad management i do n't know how this location is still open . i have had a bad experience before gave this place a second chance never again . pizza is dry and burnt
horrible food , got the pizza hut pepperoni and you can tell it 's been siting in the oven all day ! i just took 4 $ and threw it away oh well i wo n't be back
so i have n't been here in a while . i had the day off & thought it would be great to have a couple of beers & some wings . kristen b was my bartender .
the bus driver was a nice person and friendly , but did not have the qualities of a good tour guide . the company needs to hire a person for driving and a separate person for talking .
want microwaved fish for your fish taco ? go here ! this place had a dealfind coupon for $ 12 which gave us 2 burritos , 2 chips and salsa cheese and 2 drinks . i ordered the fish while the wife ordered the carne asada .
went to twelve with a group of friends . was told no hoodies aloud ( i counted at least 5 white guys in there with hoodies on and i wore one the week prior in here ) i took my hoodie off and had a pittsburgh t shirt on .
probably the worst vegas club experience i 've ever had . the venue has no ongoing theme and the space is small . the clientele are definitely sketchy folk .
payless car rental is awful i do n't recommend using them . they not only have the worst customer service but they rip off there customers by tell them a basic standard car is similar to a premium car .
the nurses and the volunteers here give you the worst attitude ever . i went up to the front desk girl in a positive mood to ask for my aunt 's room , and all she did was give me attitude . she took away my positive mood away .
front office staff very rude . they talk at you like you are stupid and do n't understand anything they are saying . wait times very long . but the drs are great . they need to keep the drs and get rid of the rest of the staff .
like a lot of things in vegas , this place is all fluff and hype and not much substance . first of all , it took 17 minutes from the time we were seated to get a beer and soda .
dont waste your time or money paying for reserved seats . we went to the movies on 12 23 and we thought we had reserved seats but when we got there , people were already sitting in them .
absolutely ridiculous waiting times . been sitting in the exam room for 45 minutes after waiting an hour in the waiting room . as with previous reviews , no sense of urgency .
went in with my two adult sons . it was busy but not the bar . so we sat at the bar and we 're served our beer quickly . but that was the last time we were noticed by the bartender .
i felt so rushed and not valued . i asked for fries twice and they were not added . my daughter did n't get the bacon that was added on her burger . the taste was fine but not woth the cost and feeling of rushed .
well here we go , back again cause my girlfriend wanted kfc . oh boy . besides messing up the order leaving out the mac and cheese apparently there cutting there tenders in half and counting them as one !
this place sucks ! they always raise rates , it 's never maintained , i had a bad scorpion infestation last month , and the place always smells like a cross between garbage and a dirty inner city hooker with a bo problem !
for a smaller bank , you would expect greater customer service and more personal treatment from its management . unfortunately , their customer policies and banking solutions do n't compare to their larger competitors .
my food was cold and they forgot half my order : - i normally check my bag but did n't for some reason until i was home . there were lettuce pieces in my bean burrito ( quality control issues ) .
ordered an angry birds cake for a coworkers going away party . thought it would be hilarious . so i picked the cake up and it was actually missing some of the birds . i spoke to an associate who stated i think they ran out '' .
please read ! do not go here ! very disappointed . my son just came home from iraq and had been saving for a car . i took him here and that tried to take full advantage of us .
tried this restaurant based on yelp reviews , and was very disappointed . spec fried rice bland and too muck fake crab . szechuan beef . not sure if it was beef and very watery and wrong kind of hot . chicken wings were old .
i truly wanted to like these cupcakes , but i have to agree with other reviews in that the cake was sort of dry , and the icing was greasy , and not buttercream . i have had better frosting from grocery stores and costco !
they need to change their name to slow burger . it took 20 minutes to get our food and they forgot our shakes . then it took another 10 minutes to get the shakes .
i have no idea how this company is still in business . the most unprofessional business i 've ever dealt with . shady shady shady stay away .
horrible fake promotions on tv do n't go there just going to try to sell you a car and give you a 5 $ target gift card
do n't ever buy jeans here ! first pair i got here they ripped in 3 different areas and they refused to give me a new pair even though they had them on the floor still .
absolutely horrible customer service . they do not have any drive to help you . you have to problem solve for them and tell them how to do their job . i 've worked in retail for 2 years and know how to do their job for them .
update : went on a vacation for 8 days and all of my nails lifted and chipped off , so had to rip off any remains so my real nails were n't pulled too . extremely mad i gave this place a try : heed the warning
ordered ribs and steak right when they opened . ribs were old and crusty . steak overdone . are they selling leftovers ? have tried this place so many times and entrees are usually poor . salad is good .
worst restuarant i have ever been to !
they lie about their specials , they do n't book you for the time you have requested and paid for , then they try to refund you by sending a check in the mail a month later .
i hope you have a layover . you 're going to need a big one . this place has average food , and a delivery time about the same as a phx to lax flight .
thought i 'd try this place . super slow the employees here move like they have no life in them . i order the 1 with fries and drink . which is clearly stated on their menu board .
these are the most unethical people you could ever do business with - before you even think of hiring them check out their lengthy court record - you can look up llc owner name very easily and then run that against the maricopa county superior court civil court records .
so i had a good experience here when finding my wedding dress , even though when i came in for my fitting they had ordered the completely wrong dress and i had to wait another month for my actual dress to come in ( i know mistakes happen ) .
awful hotel ! the air quality in room is terrible , we are staying as a group here . had to leave room go outside , because the ac is so cold , turned off it becomes so warm and stuffy , you ca n't breathe .
this place is the worst ! the customer service sucks , it 's run by a bunch of kids that do n't give a shi about helping you . they always seem annoyed to make your food . god forbid you call in a take out order .
i choose to go to the middleton location because their staff in the mckee madison location is terrible . they mixed my order not once or twice but three times ( all in one night ) and once i finally got my food it was cold .
this was the worst nail salon i have ever went to !
if you like to sleep do not move here , especially to a first floor unit . you hear everything your upstairs neighbor does especially if they are obnoxiously loud ( obviously ) .
bunch of con artists . tickets are not discounted they charge more than face value . they must have people posting fake reviews here because there is no way genuine clients could be pleased at being ripped off . shame on the theater s which cooperate with this ripoff .
the management is horrible . they say one thing and turns into another . nothing is ever organized . they let people do anything here . i used to have good neighbors , and now it seems they let anyone live here .
it has the potential to be an amazing hotel ! beautiful location , but the maintenance , upkeep and attention to details clearly is not a priority .
this ups centre gets confused about how to deliver a package easily , my package has been held for a week . and after 4 phone calls to confirm my address , they are still unable to send out my package .
terrible experience ! corned beef sandwiches were disgusted . grilled bread soaked in grease , covered with something cheese like , a tiny amount of sauerkraut , meat very difficult to chew - nightmare sandwich . please stay away !
great place if you like reheated frozen crab . slow service under and over cooked foods .
the food is basically inedible . the wings greasy , flavorless and the dipping sauces watery and tasteless . the cheese curds dreadful . the grilled veggie sandwich an abomination . i am a big guy and i could not force myself to eat this poor excuse for food .
poor service is what you get when you come here . the food may be good , but expect to wait exceptionally long for a basic burger and fries . also the female server who served us was extremely rude and overcharged us .
so sad this place use to be our favorite little hidden gem . the service and food has gone way down everything tastes like it came out of the can ! yuck im not sure what happened ?
worst nail job ever ! way over priced ! i stopped in for a quickie gel manicure and it took an hour and a half . the lady was nice but she had a hard time painting my nails .
this is the worst location . orders are consistently incorrect and rarely on time . asked for a refund due to order not even being made after 20 min
we showed up at 7:30 pm on tuesday with a restaurant half empty & it took 15 min to get a beer and over an hour to get a sandwich ! kudos to the blonde chick who never stopped moving & was bartender as well as waitress .
this place is the worst ! i live a short walk from this store so i 've tried to be more than fair because it 's such a convenient location but never again . just in the last week i 've found myself in intolerable lines .
worst service of any chilis restaurant . i 've been here multiple times and had near perfect results in being seated and then ignored for a good 10 minutes or so .
please take the lamb chops off your menu . they are incredibly bad in quality and do not fit for human consumption . the management needs to pay attention on their cleaning staffs . bathrooms should not smell like urine .
i wanted to like this place , they seemed nice enough and sanitary in that they used the plastic coverings in the pedicure bowls . tonight i walked out on my manicurist because of how rude he was .
the food is great , but the ambiance is not working for the holiday season . the decor has not change since i moved here 4 years ago . the sun beats in on the side .
i ordered a large pizza with three toppings , pizza sub , chicken wings and fish . lets start with the pizza sub 90 bread no little filling . bland pepperoni and sausage even sauce tasted metallic out of can .
thought i 'd give this place a try with 3.5 stars considering that was the best option i had . first of all , they have no idea what gluten is . being a national chain in las vegas ( all types of people coming & going ) .
if you sit at the bar , this place has the worst service ever ! i have has the same impression every time i am there .
been going her for 4 yrs . at the beginning it was great , however the past year it 's been awful . i had perfect teeth until they figured i was not making money for them .
if you want to deal with other people 's pets jumping on you while waiting to be seen , this is the place for you .
i would give it zero but i ca n't ! service passed us multiple for 15 minute , ( i ca n't make this up people ) . and they never even asked what drinks we wanted .
i was stalked and harassed , attacked and thrown down because i have a service dog . i was told by the manager it was ok to do this to me .
awful . food is gross , you do not know what you are eating . it is not good at all .
based off the reviews my coworkers and i decided to come here because we wanted authentic chinese food . i got the chicken with veggies , everything was covered with white clear gooey sauce . my egg roll was wet , everything looked like a big gooey mess .
do not use for decorative rock unfortunately they use vista landscaping and that company is terrible . additionally , not very helpful when you have to call and go several times to handle a situation .
the service is so slow it 's like watching someone in slow motion their attitude seem like they could care less if you ever came back . as for the food it 's just ok so go somewhere else .
if you like to drink at a bar that smells like vomit & urine this is the place .
highly upset ! i called early this morning to make sure there were no private parties and was assured there were n't any . i drove 45 minutes to be turned around at the door because of a private party !
steer clear of this company at all costs ! this company was dispatched to do a pool repair on a rental property . my pool service told me that the repair looked severely inadequate and sure enough 64 days later the repair failed .
unfortunately this was one of the worst upscale dining experiences i have had . the evening started out ok when we walked in -- lovely modern decor and a fun vibe . our table was n't quite ready and the cocktail i ordered at the bar was delicious .
would give no stars , because i just got sick eating this pizza the other day .
updating my review to play fair : on 12 16 13 , a box arrived with another order of cards . so the customer service representative did try to accommodate .
this mobile service started out great ! they do an excellent job on my dogs and they look great . the problem is they do not return phone calls or texts . so it is impossible to schedule an appt . the fees also went up at each appt .
one size fits all , my husband and i went to dr. craig for at least 6 months . i only saw dr. craig one time and my husband never even met him !
they are trained to sign you up for tests that total approximately $ 500 . i was told that if i change my mind about the tests i could bring my pet back in within 24 hours and they would waive the $ 100 examination fee .
buyer beware ! save your time and money and buy your sunglasses online from another retailer . the prices at solstice are almost 40 higher as compared to amazon , etc . the customer service at fashion square is pathetic to say the least as well .
went for the first time last night ! tiny portions , very expensive . guy pouring water accidentally poured water in my vodka soda . served a half bowl of soup without any bread or crackers , had to ask for them . wo n't be back .
tried contacting this guy several times using the method on his website as requested . the first time i attempted contact he got back to me relatively soon with a quote . at least twice i asked him when he could come do the work and he never responded .
absolutely horrendous service . we asked the attendant if he could make a sandwich into a salad and he said , '' sure ! '' so we ordered salads and were given sandwiches .
i wish i had the rating scale in negative . the service was so so bad.
wow , thought it would be nice ? saw a guy get murdered here monday april 18th . i have a camera that may have caught the men who did this . due to maintence ordered being ignored 3 times my camera did not catch any of this .
i had a really poor experience here . the salon is quite bare and shabby , though clean .
2 13 ruben charged me $ 1500 to rebuild my transmission . 4 months later my transmission went out . called him and he picked up my car . he had it another week and would not return my calls .
it 's been a long time since i 've been to this location and now i know why . the food is crap ! the service is ok . they do n't clean out of the trash bins .
not sure who is telling the truth , the website or the workers . went to the pandas at 930pm , they told me they were closed .
the burrito was both big and fat , but what they do n't tell you is that it is awful ! my main complaint about my burrito was the sauce - some sort of sweet bbq sauce , which is about the least mexican thing i can think of .
20 minute wait and there were 2 employees standing outside smoking . so , i took my business elsewhere .
it 's mcdonalds . i 'm going to assume we all have a handle on the food quality . but you go there for fast food . i mean , they practically invented the space .
i was excited to try this place but i 'm sorry to say that the food here sucks , at least what we ordered did , and the herbs used for the rice were weird .
i really liked this place until i came back the next day for repair and they took 5 customers ahead of me and made me wait . i waited 30-45 minutes before i just walked out .
had lunch here while staying at the casino . do not get the fish tacos . these were the worst fish tacos ever . they were entirely flavorless . i never use salt and pepper , but loaded up this time .
very disappointing . they promised seating to see and hear a concert . the table was inside behind a closed window - almost impossible to enjoy the concert . when a table became available they refused to change it and offered the check instead ( ? ! )
the work done was horrible with paint left all over the house ; it was a sloppy job and we had an extremely rude experience trying to get an itemized statement for the materials they used as we were way overcharged .
terrible experience on my most recent visit . ordered the squash fritters appetizer . from my tamarind dipping sauce , out came and baby cockroach , which crawled all over the fritters , and then our table , until we killed it with a napkin .
this location makes everything i love about noodles & co. disappear . terrible service , inability to get an order straight and an awful parking lot . there 's a chipotle right across the street and a panera right down the road . .both exceptional .
so hard to get in contact with salon . got a refund instead
great looking place with mediocre food and high prices . the quality to price ratio is so low here that i can not recommend it . the staff has been snooty to me and the food is just not worthy of the reputation it seems to have among locals .
moes at the airport sucks ! the guy who works here does n't give a f about customers ! he thinks he is doing a favor by selling food to customers !
one of my girlfriend 's dragged me along to this place and ordered the special smoothie despite me warning her .
horrible customer service and staff is unprofessional , sometimes downright rude . i always make appointments because i know they will be busy and i do n't want to wait . but during my short visits i hear enough to make me want to switch labs .
been there 2 times . it is way overpriced and the service is average . capital grille is much better . mortons is better . not a big fan .
seriously the worst company ever ! issues on super bowl sunday is not acceptable ! get your act together spectrum ! their tv app kept freezing to reload the picture throughout the entire game ! it is so frustrating !
whatever you do , do not purchase a voucher for this business from a 3rd party and then attempt to use it . multiple calls , voicemails , texts , and emails all went unanswered for me to attempt to book an appointment for over a month away .
30+ min behind on reservations ? '' you kidding me ? do n't overbook . do n't call it a reservation . do n't accept walkins until you 're caught up . jesus .
dont go here . this place is not worth it . at all . in any way . over priced beer , over priced food . terrible service with a frown . everything took forever to order and receive . however , the burrito i ordered was tasty .
they do n't do lawn maintenance or landscaping . only pool service . thanks for wasting our time !
i called to see if i could get my dog in for a grooming . left a message and received a call back . the first thing they asked was , what kind of dog i have .
this is a very eye catching store . it 's very clean and the displays are really put together well however it is so over priced . the staff are friendly , however i was treated today as if i were stupid .
it 's a red roof so my expectation is low . we were checked into 1 room that looked used and had to get switched to a new room . that was done without too much trouble . the place had a mildew smell .
went here late afternoon on 1 9 2017 . ate chicken bowl with black beans , white rice onions peppers , mild salsa and cheese - noticed symptoms ( upset stomach , nausea ) just minutes after finishing . one hour in and it worsened significantly .
my wife ordered from here and i was excited to come home and get my food as i was pretty hungry . i was across town so it took roughly an hour to get home .
nope . totally underwhelming and bland tacos . bland and kind of weird beans ( almost a fluffy texture - not what i expect from beans . ) decent service and a plus for having real iced tea . but those do n't make up for the yuck food .
had a wonderful wood fire pizza and very cold beer . service was excellent . we were made to feel very welcome . we will make this a regular stop .
papa john 's used to be my favorite pizza place until i got it from this location . it did n't taste good and it looked sloppy . but that 's not what upset me .
terrible service , terrible food , a waste of $ 100.00 . will never go again . the waitress apologize but it could n't make up for the long , long wait for the appetizer . finally got a basket of a few pieces of dried bread .
get hounded to purchase everything but the kitchen sink when you pull in for a wash from the unfriendly failed car salesmen .
totally sucked . will never go back . burgers were horrible . overpriced . and for one of the best wings in neo . i could n't tell . : (
just drove all the way over here across town and the door was locked 1pm in the afternoon on a monday 6 20 16 no one can tell me what 's going on i 'm pissed
first tine and i will never going back . wait for 1hr my car was park nobody touch it .
if i could give 0 stars i would . the service we received was horrible . we were checked on twice the almost hour we were there . food took awhile to be served . our sushi was warm . just overall not a good experience .
i am usually a very tolerant person but i was proved wrong at my visit to mysore restaurant ( btw the restaurant has nothing to do with mysore india ) .
the quality of the bbq is not that great mostly just pieces of fat and no meat and the sushi was worse . i actually worried i might get food poison from the sushi . but luckily i did not .
how is a carne asada taco greasy ? and most of the meat was salty and mostly fat ! cold tortillas that fall apart . my friend had the chicken bowl and was not impressed . chicken tasted funny . limes were old and dry .
they forgot my drink and they delivered cold food they noticeably stored for a good 7 hours or so . was not happy .
staff is super rude . absolutely no training in customer service . same for the office staff . nice place to workout if you can avoid speaking to any of the people working there .
friday afternoon and i showed up at 2 and there was a sign on the door saying will return at 2 '' . figured they would show up any minute so i waited . 30 minutes later of sitting in the hot az sun and still nobody .
penne overcooked . chicken dry . garlic bread cold . nachos lacked topping . service inattentive . refills on pop half price . would not return .
we came for business . finally wanted food after training all day . did n't think the food was going to take over 1 hour to get . it took us two hours to eat and get out .
slow as molasses and got my order wrong . i ordered one iced coffee with sugar-free vanilla . how do you mess that up ? i was the only customer in the drive through and it was n't busy inside . no excuse for the incompetence .
had a coupon would n't take it now charging me for a deep conditioning when all i wanted was a cut and blow dry
this is the worst car wash service i have ever worked with ! do not buy the groupon or living social coupon ! i tried to make multiple attempts at scheduling the service , i even took time off work and these people did not show up 3 times !
do n't go here ! i was there last week , i asked the guy before hand how much for the tattoo , he said $ 25 , i say ok cool lets do it . when he got done he said $ 65 . i said what ?
do not rent ! this place is horrible it looks nice but so not worth it . 1 . only got one parking space 2 . my sisters car got towed within a month of being here because there was n't any parking space available 3 .
to the person who gave this place 4 5 stars , you 've got to be kidding . i 've eaten there recently . .had to . and while the food passes , the place is filthy .
the food was oddly bland , and the servers took forever to take our order ( i think the person i went with never even got her drink ) .
went in for a haircut and the woman cutting my hair was not a good stylist ( i wo n't say her name as to no embarrass her ) . first , she wanted to cut my fine hair dry . say what ?
over the memorial day weekend brought my dogs in to get groomed . unfortunately i did not have the paper work for their rabies but had their tags and the name of the clinic which where they received the shots .
it 's a $ 42 dollar oil . they claim to clean your windows and vacuum your carpet . they literally did n't vacuum a single part of my car . i showed the manager and he offered to do it himself , i said forget it .
was a weekly loyal customer for years . im a fan of supporting local small businesses . most his staff are lovely to deal with , and i thought the owner was a charming gentlemen .
it was overpriced and gross i will never go again . did n't even finish my food half way none of us did . our drinks were hot like literally hot my burger smelled and the bread was hard as a rock !
i love the food but the owners are very rude . i made a mistake on my order called back to see if i could correct it and she told me no the order is on the way .
got take out from here . the food was just ok . but the service was terrible . while i waited for the food the owner was chatting up a family waiting for a table .
promised a check was going to be mailed in may , have n't received anything as of today . phone 's not being answered . i 'm paying 1 visit , then pursuing a criminal suit .
the food was literally repulsive . everything was totally inedible . the chicken was dry , the flavouring of the kabob and hamburger where as though they were attempting to fuse dog food into their taste mix . serious gross .
we 're on the do not call list and by them calling us . they are violating a federal law . i told them the first time that if they call again that i will file a lawsuit against the company for harassment .
terrible food and service . i ordered delivery to the pool , was told by the delivery man that they included forks and spoons , which was a lie .
this is the worst place i had ever rented a car . i waited over an hour and a half even i had reservations in line to pick up our car . i asked and showed staff my reservation paper and she told me to wait in line anyway .
i was pretty excited when i saw this location was down the street from my new house . unfortunately i wo n't be shopping here . i 've been in 3 times and left empty handed . the prices are not worth it .
park is nice and love all the green grass . i brought my 5 and 3 yr old for some fun , but then these middle school kids were climbing on top of the shade fabric . which is why i assume one is all ripped .
ate there for the first time today . ordered a barbecue sandwich . tasted ok nothing special until i started chewing something odd , a piece of aluminum foil . showed to one of the staff and after about ten minutes got some lame excuses but no apology .
going to native for a second time reminded me why i dont like it.i will never go back to this place ! service and food were horrible . first off , it took about 10-15 minutes to even get our drinks.
i have been to several on the west coast and by far this has to be the worst one . my first time in cle and i decided to give this place a try .
there are a ton of people at this terminal trying to get checked in for international flights . i am not surprised they say be here three hours early because you stand around for the first hour doing nothing . plane leaves at 6 am .
this is a good place to sale your clothes if your willing to endure the always rude and disrespectful employees . and as far as shopping goes i 'd stay away . although the store is huge it 's filled with over priced trash .
terribly badly organized - closing security stations at will with no rhyme or reason making people endlessly wander around phoenix airport . your chances to miss your plane because of immensely long lines at tsa : immensely high ! best option : try not to go through phoenix airport .
one star because the bed was decent and yelp does n't low anything lower . everything else was absolutely awful . bad breakfast . bad carpet . small outdated bathroom . broken coffee pot . loud halls . i did n't book this hotel .
thought they were the most flavorless and driest cupcakes i have ever tried . the frosting was the only decent part . based on other reviews maybe i had a bad batch , but they should check them . either way i will never go there again .
a bunch of idiots working at the store . their employees attitudes are the worst . they have no idea how to run a register . will never go back to shop their meager stock of overpriced crap .
small local business that makes greasy thin crust pizza that is really tasty .
worst customer service and worst job . they treated me like i was stupid and they did the worst job on my car !
this is not a review about the food because there was no room at the inn .
a great deal . with a great deal of hassle ! my experience with this clinic has been trying at best . staff turnover has been very high and that is not surprising based on the attitudes of some of the management .
i wish the younger girl with long hair was working here again . she threaded my brows really good and was a lot more gentle .
the pharmacy staff at this location does their best with the little support they get from corporate . what the public does not know is that behind those computer screens and pharmacy registers are a myriad of things going on .
after scheduling and appointment '' due to upstairs unit not cooling properly we were contacted that they would have to reschedule the appointment so we did . after rescheduling several times and having to take two days off work they called and said they had to reschedule once again .
wow . it takes a lot for me to give 1 star , especially to a small , mom & pop place . bottom line : go elsewhere .
filthy . all garbage cans literally overflowing . flippant attitude when advised the place is filthy . then i used the bathroom . overflowing garbage in there too . and the toilet is broken and does n't flush . the shelves are disgusting too .
it 's a 15 minute wait for it mediocre fast food dim sum and they wo n't even serve you a glass of water this place is a joke
i walked into this establishment , and i asked a simple question that could not be answered in english . the question was where is your bathroom . they do not have one ? that means the customers can not wash their hands before eating at this subway .
scumbags trying to scam the public . this is fraud no service no customer service nothing but a scam
i walked into this bank at 4:20pm on a thursday afternoon . the teller line was pretty full when i walked in and there is nobody on the outside to greet you if you need assistance to meet with a banker .
called john and he replied with a text , under a sink , will call you tonight . '' he did not . i called to remind him and never got another reply . moving on .
i decided to edit my review and not be so brutal , however , the truth needs to be told of my experience .
i do n't know why amazon uses lasership - this is an extremely unreliable courier company . amazon deliveries via lasership are always after 9:00 pm if they arrive . and it 's hit and miss if they arrive at all .
where 're negative stars ? i would give this shop negative 10 stars . horrible customer service : no voicemail , no informing clients that the order is ready , rude and blaming everyone for their own mistakes . took 2 months to fix our vacuum . 2 months !
holly stinky plane ! jfk las flight smelled like sewage and floor was all wet in first class cabin . i guess that is welcome aroma for free upgrade wannabe first class 's travelers ?
first off the food is n't great it 's just normal pub fare . secondly the service is terrible it was n't busy yet i could n't get a glass of water after i got my food . i wo n't be going here again .
another case of big corporate quasi govt too big to care and too big to fail '' place . the service here is slow . only one teller working .
horrible place . the staff was less than knowledgeable and unprofessional . i called to make an appointment for my son and they said we do not have any doctor to see him .
do not use they lie about repairs break promises . they make there renters responsible for home repairs ! stay away !
i went to buffalo exchange last friday because i wanted to get some jeans . i was really excited because you never know what you will find .
no longer accepts debit cards at the pumps . could n't find soda i wanted inside . terrible service .
i 'm never going here again . not only did i feel so annoyed with how hard they were trying to sale upgraded things , they are extremely pushy and argue with you about things . they took forever to do a basic easy service .
terrible service , sloppy food . more cream cheese on the outside of my bagel than inside and bagel partially burned so practically inedible . wo n't be back .
terrible food . i ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and they gave me lettuce and chicken and squirted some buffalo sauce on it . nothing that can not be done at home in less than 5 mins . it 's worse than subway and more expensive .
the place used to be good when it first opened , since then no one is at the font to seat you , the calamari is okay , the jerk chicken is great .
i agree that the $ 20 per hour rate is very good but this has come at a price of my time having to clean after they leave . i gave them several chances and they could n't deliver the cleaning i was looking for .
walked in and was n't greeted . two people were waiting when i was there . i made eye contact with one of the barbers and said hi with no response . i waited 10 to 15 minutes .
disappointed with this place . have tried a few times to give them the benefit of the doubt , but too many times there have been problems .
hm , not sure where to start . one time they had to shut off our water for 2 days and the only compensation we got was a case of water . yes , they did expect us to use water bottles to shower .
i can not believe how horrible this place was . they are clearly not prepared for any type of business and the managers should be fired . rude , unacceptable service with no apologies .
made a reservation at bac tonight at 8pm . we were seated at 8:05 , waited at out table until 8:25 and then left after not one employee visited our table .
well this was my last time going to this zoe 's location . i was giving them another shot after messing up my order in one way or another the last 2 times i 've been here - they did it a third time .
chen & wok is simply bad fast food chinese . no ambience . .with a horrible little chinese woman who takes orders and gives nasty looks and no customer service at all !
what 's worse than greasy mexican food ? cold greasy mexican food ! i ordered the super nachos which were slathered in cold beans and unmelted cheese . gross ! my man ordered the cheese enchilada , which was also cold and full of unmelted cheese .
advertised a $ 50 gift card for test driving a new nissan . after driving the car and talking to the sales manager i was informed that they ran out '' of gift cards .
horrible service. we took like 2 hours to rent the car plus 1 hour waiting for the van to get to the airport .
treated poorly by the staff. we stopped in for a nightcap after a show and were greeted with a who the f are you attitude. we were n't dressed up enough for their liking i suppose so we fished our beers which took forever to get and left .
the end of march i had someone come out to see why my fiberglass spa was stained black .
not worth it . not worth the cover . not worth the drink prices . shot girls '' were rude and just standing around and nothing to look at .
there are few times in life when a company is so despicable i wish there were negative stars . i am so sorry i do not feel the need to carry a credit card and enterprise sees fit to punish me for it .
our family came to visit from the middle east and we were looking forward to having a wonderful meal and wonderful service . unfortunately , the red head russian waitress provided very poor customer service . service without a smile . .just saying .
hi there i rarely reviews any business but for this one i had to write these lines as i had first hand experience and it was the worst experience . beware do n't get intimidated by their professional voice over the phone .
ordered 2 items : - half roast duck - clay pot sea bass with tofu flavor of food is just ok. not spectacular . however service this evening was horrible .
if you like huge portions of fried and greasy food eat here . i tried this out because it has high ratings . well i 'm a food snob and i like high quality food . sure the prices are low but the food is n't good .
pad thai is small and taste like rubber . stir fry vegetables the portion was stupid small .
if you are visiting from the states , stay away . they jack up the prices from what they charge in the us ( at least on the west coast ) for the exact same food
i had some work done a few years back and i 'm continuously still having issues with their modifications to my suv . first off , the tires put on were too low profile to sustain the weight of the vehicle .
worst customer service i 've experienced at a t-mobile store . which is a shame , because t-mobile is an awesome company with amazing coverage ! i walked in to add a line , and only one other customer was in the store .
this place was awful ! i took my puppy here cause she was puking , not responding , and all around was not herself .
my last visit here sucked . i suggested to my mom and brother to come here after my great experience the first time . we came on a weekday around 5pm . my brother ordered their sashimi plate and it was pretty pathetic .
you call it in and still have to wait for your food when you arrive . ready in 15 ins means 15 mins not another 10 or 15mins . i work close to here and will never go in again .
the margaritas which macayos calls the best in phoenix '' are not . that 's the nicest way i can say it . just do n't waste your money on them . the food is decent but bland . the guacamole was excellent .
this is my first yelp review . i felt it was necessary . dont eat here . it 's absurdly expensive for what you get . i ordered the ultimate '' sandwich - it 's $ 13 without a drink . the fries was served cold .
my heater was broken in my house . just in time came to my house , spend an hour trying to fix my heater and just left without telling me the issue .
this place makes macayos taste authentic . in a city full of incredible mexican food , how do places like this stay in business ? salsa is from either a can or jar .
i 've seen her for 1 year now . not good . wait time is ridiculous . what is the point of making an appointment if your going to get seen 1 hour later . the staff are young inexperienced girls .
two of us for lunch on a wednesday . margherita pizza which was so mushy as to be inedible a greasy linguine dish paired with a mushy breaded chicken way overpriced caesar with what was clearly brought in dressing ( i.e .
the guys working were talking shit about me because i did n't hear what one of them said the first time . thankfully , my boyfriend did hear them . the guy making my sandwich also decided that extra onions means adding three extra little pieces .
i went to pio pio in dilworth two days prior and decided that since i live closer to this one to try this . worst customer service ever !
i 've been going here for a while and the service keeps getting worse . i wo n't be back .
want to pay too much for a mediocre meal ? then have you found the right place .
monday 12:30 pm was slow so i should have known . ate on the roof top patio . slow service ! dirty tea glass ! food took forever ! spring rolls were greasy but was to hungry to send them back since they took so long to get .
nothing rapido about this place and it 's a total rip . if i 'm getting an $ 8 side salad or a $ 3 meatless taco i should at least get it in a reasonable amount of time .
very horrible service they took 50 dollars from the account when i cancelled my membership never waste your time on this app better be find your own house without ally listings
we ordered few things for lunch today but were not impressed .
upon ordering , i presented the coupon for free appetizer and ordered several different plates . at end of meal , waitress forgot all about the coupon and did n't ring up the discount even though it was placed there with the credit card .
strange business . sells meat by the lb . but not ribs by the rack , have to buy a meal . sides are sized small or tiny . ca n't get pint or quart size for party , have buy lots of small or tiny .
bill emerson from appliance specialists or appliance pros is very good . at scamming people . my issue has been going on since march . he took $ 740 from me to repair my refrigerator that never worked after he repaired '' it .
this is the worst branch of the worst bank i have ever dealt with . this is a chronic problem i have dealt with for over 10 years . there has never been a pleasant , efficient transaction . .and i am sure there never will be .
i was away for memorial weekend and my father drove a hour to see the vet because my westie has a history of skin problems . normally a vet will give her steroids to treat and antibiotics . my dog was biting her fur out and caused some infections .
you make coffee addictive then you over price it . only 1 person working today. at a starbucks. let me just wait in line for 13 minutes.
do not move in here . people are out late at the pool playing loud music . everyone smokes openly the hallways and rooms and management does nothing about it , even though they claim to be smoke free '' .
small portions . tasted just acceptable . not so fresh tasting proteins . steep prices . owner was warm and friendly but that doesnt cut it . increase portion sizes and change the recipes on the proteins
very overpriced screen protector . i got one last year it 's not even a good protector . went to the cart in the mall cause it came lose on the top . they wanted $ 30 since they said it was n't covered by warranty .
i did the web check in to try and save my self some time , but it only resulted in having to wait longer . it took them 40 mins to call me to come in . when i got there i was asked to wait even more time .
completely ruined my hair . i had highlights done in a bright white color when i have brown hair . not only was the color awful , she started the highlight an inch down my scalp and was completely crooked so it looked like i already had roots .
this has to be the worst pita establishment . the service and food are terrible . if i could give 0 or less stars i would . do your stomach a favour . .please do not eat here
bought a dishwasher last wednesday that was supposed to be delivered the next day .
was disappointed . i did n't find what i was hoping to have on the menu . it was breakfast and had to wait for coffee . finally ordered oatmeal . paid $ 4 ( $ 2 for each item ordered ) extra for pecans and berries .
i was very unhappy when i had taken my dog here . i will not be back . please do not go here they do the dogs so fast that it is ridiculous for the price they charge .
i 'm not one to just give out one star . i like to give places benefit of the doubt , but after our experience at kamasutra a couple days ago , i 've changed my mind .
extremely slow service . waitress did n't come back to check on us ( we were a party of 8 ) . majority only got water so this should be a no brainer .
i can not recommend this place .
i went in and i was surprised that there was a line up , more surprising was the half the restaurant was full with customer while the other other half of the tables where full of dirty dishes . there was only one server on duty .
horrible place to live . my air conditioning broke down a total of four times my stay here . maintenance takes days to fix it ! if you go to the office , they will pretend to care about your problems but it never gets solved .
decided to give this place a shot , wish i had n't .
i concur with the other reviewers and would give this place a 0 if i could . food was small in portions and not filling at all for the price you pay .
ordered delivery for lunch at my work today and could not be so displeased with the food order . i ordered the chicken teriyaki with rice but the dish came back as half order .
i no longer will ever been going to this pizza hit again . i ordered my pizza and they said it 'll be done around 10:15 . okay great . we order wings , bread sticks and a large cheese pizza . we get there to pick up order .
i am a huge subway fan for quick cheap eats . a subway lunch has been the norm for me over the past 5 years . at this location , food is average for a subway but the service is the worst you will find .
it 's not rocket science . if a store has an obvious high demand for a product , you should order more product at a time so your store does n't run out .
we stayed at the mini suite on the 10th floor . the room was beautiful and spacious . but the cons are - the room was adjacent to the fremont street experience and the live music was very loud that items shook off the nightstand .
wow . i read the reviews on this place and expected a really good pedicure . wrong ! one of the worst i have ever had and i go monthly .
by far the worst tilted kilt i 've been to . ever time i give it another try i sit at the bar for a good 15 minutes before getting a drink i 've even had to get up and just walk out .
we went there for the sunday brunch . we got there at about 1230 . and there was already no desserts available , that are supposed to come with the brunch . there were cold pancakes , cold eggs , and over cooked sausage .
my wife and i were drawn to community montessori through all of the positive online reviews . unfortunately , our experience with the school and janet in particular , were anything but positive .
first time here and my last . ok i 'm vegan with a cheat day here and there . i wasted a cheat day on this ! i got a carne asada burrito with frys added .
i am in disbelief at the outrageously priced food here . two medium pizzas , 18 wings and two domestic beers for $ 75 ! for mediocre pizza and wings . i have had pizza and wings with craft beer that are much higher quality for half the price .
every time i am craving for a slush on a hot sunny day . their slushy machine is always broken ! for the past month every time i go . it 's always broken .
worst experience in a breakfast place i have ever had . my bread was moldy ! yum , and the service was terrible . stay away .
this place has absolutely no respect for its patrons . supposed to open at 9 , the receptionist strolled in at 9:10 , and the doctor did not get in until 9:30 . ridiculous .
if i could give this place zero stars i would . the worst tanning facility i 've ever been to in the country .
woke up late and i really want a quick breakfast and got a really bad service and equally lousy food at nathan 's in the las vegas strip food court .
rude . we asked for gluten free crust and the waitress was super rude about saying no '' . i understand you may not have it but the way she said we do n't have it '' ( direct quote ) was disrespectful and straight rude .
i called this place this morning injuring about a bmw x5 for sale to make sure it was there and had not been sold before i made the hour drive to the dealership , i got there and it was gone !
we found the shasta process to be a waste of time . when we contacted the company to start the process they sent someone out to take the measurements . the next person came out to bring their brochures and talk about how great shasta is .
my wife and i have collectively been to hundreds of happy hours and this is by far the worst ever ! do n't be fooled by low prices - if it is poorly made then its not a bargain .
this is supposed to be a fast food but i waited 25 minutes in line . employees were moving in slow motion . need to get some energy drinks there people !
so disappointing . not only did the service take forever , the meat was dry , the corn was dry , the buns were dry . it 's unfortunate . last time we were here , it was great .
cool atmosphere but terrible service . there was maybe 3 tables that were occupied in the whole place , not busy at all but still took 10 mins for the waiter to come to us . we told him we just wanted drinks .
i would like to start off with this franchise provides false advertising . as indicated on their website and on their voice mail you are able to use their seven day trail pass . upon arrival was told that the trial pass is not valid at the stockyards location .
for being so overpriced i was not impressed . the batter is not seasoned at all ! they were n't very friendly either which is surprising for a small business . wo n't be returning .
seriously the grossest restaurant ever ! i 'll never the day i had a roach in my hash browns and in return they offered me water ! i 'll pass , nastiest restaurant in las vegas
there 's no option for a 0 so i have to give it that 1 star . it looked really nice from the outside but i had the worst experience ever ! i went to get acrylic nails and my technician ( sabrina ) seemed very inexperienced .
walked in and right back out . the room was very greasy . did not want to smell like what they were grilling when i left . also not a vegetarian friendly place .
i called this salon after seeing mixed reviews on yelp . i asked of they took appt a and i was told no . i asked if they had short curly lightly colored hair .
really pissed these people . i was a slot machine for 30 minutes and not one waitress came by ! i was another one for about an hour and the waitress took 15 minutes least to come by each time .
total waste of time . called yesterday afternoon to make sure they had the tile i needed . the woman said they had plenty at $ 7.99 sf . we drove over an hour to the store and they told us they did n't have the tile .
worst airlines i have ever flown . had to change my flight because of illness and had to pay a 200.00 fee . with trip insurance ! and this is why i only fly sw airlines ! planes were dirty and hostesses were rude .
parking is in a strip mall , and it has been here for a few years . only reason my family and i went here was because we wanted to try a different pho place .
i wish i could give zero stars bec the attitude of this place is lame as hell . first of all , my husband got a caramel frappe and the cashier came up and told me that all they have left is oreo . um ?
as it says on the web friendly ! but it 's the opposite . this location when it comes to customer service sucks . treat your customers well because it 's your bread and butter .
our family goes to starbucks on a daily basis . this was the worst bar none experience that i have ever had at a starbucks .
by far the worst customer service i have ever experience . first i was told that i was due for an upgrade . the employee was helpful at first . she called corporate to upgrade me . they told her i was good to go .
visited yesterday for lunch . my order was the only one being worked in the kitchen . they forgot to cook my fries until after my chicken sandwich was done & in the pass for service . i know this because the loud conversation between staff .
used to be 5 star . amazing food . was amazing until they did away with not only sicilian choice . but took away 24 wing order ? why ? 12 or 36 now ? the deal before was way more reasonable large + 24 wings . easy decision .
good burgers , not great , but good . potato wedges average . cleanliness , they need to look that word up , staff was i 'd rather be elsewhere attitude
it awful , dirty , and food is gross and not cooked ! it is not clean ! they do not clean tables , or replace items , they leave left over food on forks , glasses dirty , place is gross .
do n't waste your money here ! there 's a way better sushi joint down the street .
worst food i 've ever had ! like hospital food , so bland , small portions and slow service . do n't waste your $ $
nice looking place at phx , terminal 4 , but looks can be deceiving . many menu items not available , and once we found one that was , they brought us the wrong item . they have a mac n cheese entree , that comes in three varieties .
this is the worst service . i have ever experienced . extremely rude customer service , only muffins and coffee available at a 24 7 location , and totally inept staff . absolutely unacceptable .
honestly i do n't think the employees of this walmart could move any slower . i 've been standing in the customer service line for 20 minutes and it literally has n't moved . horrible customer service .
what was dunkin donuts thinking when they took out the selection of donuts and now only offer a choice of 10 . it used to be you could n't decide which one to get , now you just have to settle for what they have .
i called to have our home serviced after receiving a postcard in the mail . the man came and was very nice but tried to upsell me the entire time .
terrible customer service , i was first in line to open a business account , waited for an hour and left because they still did n't have anyone to help me , if you can avoid going to this branch i would strongly recommend doing so .
this is a review of the snack bar area . i love target but the snack bar area is a freakin dump ! every single table right now is filthy and does n't look like they have been cleaned all day . gross .
to be avoided at all costs . i 'm not sure how they find their doctors but all three out of the four times i 've been to the clinic i had an absolutely terrible experience .
carpet is dirty with trash and food stains . sorry but tonight is the first and last time i am going here . still looking for a great asian buffet spot in phoenix , i might try jasmine tokyo in scottsdale next
i just had the worst experience i 've ever had getting a pedicure . the entire experience took less than twenty minutes because she rushed through the entire thing .
butter chicken is a little too sweet and i 'm currently upset they gave me cold naan ( typically when made to order , as it should be , it 's delicious here ) .
wtf ! this place needs a lot of repairs . they have games that are halfway way working .
went there at 7:45pm on thurs & it was closed ( it 's not a holiday ) -- it was wed 1 10 13 .
i have to give a star to give a review so i picked one . their food quality has gone down big time . not only is their pizza disgusting , greasy , and mushy but i got a salad today and i feel sick to my stomach !
terrible service . cold food . i went here with my two daughters for lunch . we were sat very quickly and our orders taken promptly . we ordered a drink each with appetizers and a main meal . the appetizer came and was good .
super slow drink service , no itemized receipt , expensive watered down drinks , expensive parking , and slow elevator ( only one )
food is typical mexican . chips and salsa are delivered to your table promptly . service is hit and miss . we had a very rude waiter and a very long wait during a slow time . i have not gone back since .
dreadful place , horrible service , and products are bad at best . my mother wouldnt listen and insisted on checking out there inventory . total waste of time . there are no good locations here but this place is no good .
came in about a month ago and ( who i believe to be the manager ) craig attempted to help me and failed miserably .
this is my third visit here and the service is terrible . they do not need to let teenagers run the registers .
the wedding coordinator i had was terrible . i was being told things were going to get done but then on the day of , nothing ! it has been a few months and i 'm still hurt . i can never get that day back .
i have been taking my pug to them for 2 years now . few days ago i left my dog with them for a hair cut and bath .
very plain salad that lacks flavor . the lettuce was bitter . i gagged and could n't even go through half of my salad .
made reservation for 8:00 at the desk . arrived & they said our reservation was n't in the system . sorry we are full '' . nothing we can do '' . just rude !
i finally had to call in another exterminator , and surprise , surprise . no bugs . wo n't be calling this place again . do n't waste your money .
went to eat there and had a craving for it but was completely disappointed . the food was cold and the flavors were tasteless . the food was 2 days old and was not fresh . we got sick the next day .
i have never written a yelp review . ever . this establishment forced me to .
worse customer service ! go else where ! called to check if they carried a tree . was told i had to come in ! really ! called the next company and was told they did ! guess what i purchased from them not you !
these people are only in it for the money . my dog needed surgery to remove a tumor and they quoted me over $ 1,000 dollars which i had to have up front .
trust the stars . do not go here ! too long to type all the issues but awful service and they are very uneducated .
this review is specifically about the assistant manager , sean . unfortunately , i had a very negative experience here .
oh dear lord , please avoid this place at all costs . placed an online order only to find out i had a 160 minute wait with no other options . drove in to pick the order up only to find chaos .
i 'm pretty disappointed in this location . i called in an order and though my food is sitting there ready , i 'm standing in a line of over 20 people just waiting to pay for it .
i called in for membership information and all the kid kept on saying if we can give you information over the phone , management has instructed us to have membership conversation over the phone '' are you ^ & ing kidding ! wake up !
they lost my dad ! he is on hospice and was being transported to a facility with several locations .
this is the most depressing furniture store i have ever been to . it looks like it is all used furniture . i was looking for decorations . but if i was looking for furniture i would rather go to goodwill than this place . horrible !
never go to this restaurant ! it 's one of the worst places i 've ever been to ! the staff is rude and unprofessional ! the crowd is loud and the food is nuked in the microwave and should be considered fast food .
this place used to be pretty good , but they have gone downhill in the last year or so . the service has always been iffy , but it was really terrible today .
horrible ! do not waste your money or time ! we reserved a room for a staycation here and we ended up leaving late that night due to the awful noise ! we went home and did n't use this room at all .
camelback and 24th st. its the csi club cause the rug looks like it should be taped off ! mold in the bathrooms , broken tile , broken glass in the yoga room , gum on the floor etc etc etc etc
not even worthy of a one star . i ordered a chicken souvlaki for delivery however the person delivering it went to the wrong address and i had to wait .
one of the worst fast food places ever . this place was filthy and the customer service is non existent . from now on i will just go to the mcdonald 's on 16th street and glendale where they care about cleaning and good customer service .
went in on a wed night after work for cat food . saw they did n't have what i wanted and tried to leave . i was in the store less then 60 seconds .
these people are rude sometimes they gets things done , but horrible customer service ! never go here ! they charge hefty fees without telling you anything . do not ever go here !
waited for over and hour and i still had not been seen , unprofessional staff , walked out . will not return . do not recommend .
everything was bad the hamburger . there was no parmesan cheese on the caesar salad . it was only for french fries that came with the burger . and the caesar salad was just lettuce and croutons i had for extra dressing they gave me one dress
worst dr . i have ever been to ! he is very degrading and said horrible things to me . he acted like i did n't know anything and tried to pin my sweet husband against me . he is a creep ! stay away from this office !
poor office communication & horrible wait times . i brought my mother here for an ultrasound . she 's diabetic and had to fast since midnight and they called her back after an hour of waiting .
worst experience ever . our waiter was a pompous jerk who came back to our table twice until our bill was due and then he was back every two minutes even though our wine was n't finished .
i was fooled by the review . salad was not fresh . veggies were wilted . the pita were not warm , the shawarma is substandard . i 'll go back to jerusalem grill . has the best chicken shawarma
walk in 10 people in line with one person at counter strike 1 then they double charged my credit card strike 2 . then i asked a simple question . do you have vacuum cleaner bags ? you would think they would . they sell vacuums .
this is the worst home inspection available . after we moved in there were issues everywhere .
2nd time ordering online and both times late late late . they say 30-40 min . what a joke . cold pizza and waiting way too long ! more like cold pizza an hour or more later . gave them a 2nd chance and what a joke .
horrible customer service . guy at the first window gave me attitude , as well as they gave me a uncooked fry . this is horrible .
i will never fly united again . .i was conned into getting a middle seat by a low airfare ( economy ) in which they never mentioned this comes with a middle seating assignment ! sucks !
do not make the mistake i made . we decided to order breakfast they had huge images shown looked good . well - the pancakes were gray ! not golden -- - but gray .
do not waste your money here ! they do n't care about customers . first , they have a patio but they either wo n't let you on it or if they do , they complain that they forget customers out there and did n't put sunscreen on .
how in the hell does a bank think it 's appropriate to have one freaking teller for the whole bank . like seriously just one . they have about 6-8 in the back not doing anything to help this one teller and 10 people waiting on line .
one star is all i got ! when you go to a new '' place you would think the staff would know what a drink they are going to be selling is or what it consists of . ha , not so much here !
driver cancelled on me after stalling for 25 minutes . uber is way better , more cars and much better customer service .
do not do business with these guys . they are crooks and will steal your money . i placed my order in january to the tune of $ 205 and have yet to receive anything .
all the positive reviews on here are fake . if you looked up this company before buying . good job . if not , sorry , good luck ever getting a hold of them
ridiculously expensive . i ordered a salad which was basically a pile of greens with almost nothing else and a drink and wound up spending near $ 20 . insane !
funny how 24 hour emergency service offering companies never seem to have anyone available until the next business day afternoon .
not trying to make a big deal out of this , however there was half a band-aid in my pasta . not sure where the other half is .
yikes ! the food quality and service at this joint was awful ! the interior and exterior of the place looks amazing and fresh , honestly a job well done , love the all woodwork . that being said i felt like i have had better at taco bell .
the care we received was substandard . my mother in law was recovering from heart surgery and not doing well . we noticed something was wrong but the nurses kept insisting everything was ok .
worst hair cut i have ever had ! my stylist started hacking at my hair the minute i was in the chair . my hair was not even wet ! it looks nothing like the picture i brought in .
this location did n't have honey glazed munchkins at 5 pm . never had that happen before . the guy making the donuts seemed pretty apathetic about it .
stay away ! receive deal from groupon and it is near my home so i decided to try it . huge mistake . i refuse to go into detail for fear of lawsuit .
omg horrible service here . went in this morning to fill up . knew i had 20 cents off from vons rewards .
worst customer service ! , food are n't even that great . orchid 's garden dimsum is wayyy better . this was our first time coming to this place , it will be our last time . not worth your time and money
you could receive better customer service at a walmart ! that is being very generous . at first i was really impressed with their selection and very eager to buy quite a few things .
food was ok. service was horrible . ordered from uber eats , they did n't bring the cutlery , i called and ask if they can bring it , they told me i should have requested it in uber eats . is n't providing cutlery a basic requirement ?
sorry to say the people complaining are all correct . gave me the wrong order . forgot the pepperoni . they remembered '' the onion on a pizza . they remembered the onion and forgot the pepperoni . i think i could forgive forgive forgetting the onion .
these owners do n't care about any of their customers . when you have a complaint , you get the deer in headlights look . they shrank all of my polo shirts and the woman could n't have cared less .
change of ownership brought this formerly 5 star dive bar to negative rating . the place caters to thugs and drunks who they over serve .
early on 10 15 14 i went online and ordered flowers from blooming days floral for my supervisor for bosses day . i called in the morning of 10 16 14 and a lady answered .
sorry i could n't give a zero . work is very good , however she gives a price and after the work is finished she doubled it . i brought in to pairs of pants the receipt and agreed price was 35 dollars .
i reserved a room here for my in laws who were coming to town for a funeral . i assumed by the location that it would be nice because it would mostly attract people that were in town for business . unfortunately my in laws had a bad experience .
the lady at the drive thru was taking my order then told me to hold on and came back 2 minutes later to finish taking my order . when i got to the window to pay , she only got down half of my order ?
crawling with roaches ! saw four just getting a fountain drink ! walked back out . ca n't imagine getting food there .
i found cora 's to be bland and a few dollars per plate too expensive . i was visiting from san diego and had the 2 egg 2 bacon plate and my mom had a french toast plate with some sliced fruit and coffee . the coffee was tasteless .
i had a terrible experience here . i had been to applebee 's in other states , and the décor and atmosphere was nicer . they had wooden floors and an open feel . this place had carpet ! carpet ? that 's disgusting !
oh my my my . .i traveled from kansas to watch my grandson play in a tournament here and i feel a little lucky to make it out in one piece !
i wish no stars was an option . went to look at a used vehicle , gave them notice i was coming and they did n't even decide to vacuum out the vehicle or wash off the spilt milk from the seat .
wayne is the biggest ripoff artist . rude . charged me 120 $ just to switch my tired over . he gives asians a bad name . i asked this jerk to lend me a tool just too tighten up a bolt and he would n't even do that .
i 've been here twice so far and it was mediocre at best both times . service is absolutely terrible . they take forever to take your order , and the woman is incredibly rude .
what a shit hole this place is . grade 8 graduation held here with a charge per guest for dinner .
not to be mean but my fiancé and i have been eyeing this place for a while and finally went to check it out .
worst customer service experience ever . luis with a mickey mouse shirt was no help .
so i went in for glasses but was very disappointed . i used my vision insurance to purchase my glasses . when my glasses came in they were n't right , so i went back for a re-check .
do not , i say do not go to this place . .in every aspect it is a bad place , we went there for breakfast at 10 am , it is advertised to be till 11 am and they said that we have only one item .
the dr.s are wonderful as long as you are patient enough to wait . my first visit i actually had to walk out because i waited over an hour and was skipped for the next patient at least twice .
the most annoying thing a car dealership can do is not have their prices posted on the car . i should n't have to waste my time talking to someone before i know if i 'm interested .
this place sucks poor service and awful employees . this place needs to shut down . nobody is friendly , and everyone is stuck up . i recommend never going here . also , they will accuse you of using a product so that you can not return it .
this was my first time in a strip joint . not the best place . the girls here are pretty average to low average . the two dancers i did see where not all that great looking . the bartenders appeared to be better looking then the two dancers .
i have nothing but trouble with this place starting from the front office to the billing ( if you can figure out their billing system online , mail or direct contact ) . trouble is they really do n't seem to care .
i tried this nail salon as a last minute new set . the lady did my nails too thin and no matter how many times i asked her to add another layer of acrylic she said trust me i know what i 'm doing .
completely awful ! pens game 7 , scarce crowd and still waited over 10 minutes before we decided to leave . the manager walked by us many times without a word . stay away !
we have visited this restaurant 3 times and the ribs were the best , service was always terrible but as long as the food was good , we over looked the service .
called at 8am , they did n't even bother calling me back . skip this place and use edwards plumbing ! they answered , responded and came the same day !
this may have been a nice experience if it had n't been for the grumpy waiter . he was definitely in a foul mood and seemed bothered we were there .
best car wash ever ! make sure you ask for the manager 's special ! ! ''
i have lived in several states around the country . as most folks know , just because a chain store is good one place does n't guarantee that it will be somewhere else . this is no more apparent than at this cvs 's pharmacy .
we went to look at bunk beds mattresses . we were initially greeted and welcomed , at the door . that nice feeling lasted about 30 seconds .
went here very recently and had to literally climb over pallets in the middle of what should 've been an aisle in a few areas in the store , seems that would be a fire hazard anywhere else . customer service is n't a strong point here at all .
terrible , larry represented me , for one court case . i found out 3 weeks after a supposed court date that i had a warrant . no communication , just simply a money making scheme that they run . beware
what a headache this company has been . i never write reviews but this is worth it . their communication is horrible , horrible , horrible . they do not answer the phone for maintenance problems , no no no .
complete waste of my time . front office needs to get their act together ! told me to be there 30 mins early , then when i show up to a locked door insisted that they never said that . i 'm a liar ?
my boyfriend ordered his suit from this store . they forgot to order the tie for him because they did n't know what color it was ( the groom had it in the system ) .
ordered some quick take out from here tonight . some sashimi and a tuna roll . arriving home to eat , i open the box and am greeted by green fish . which , would be ok if it were candy , and not tuna sashimi .
this company is also known as sears garage door solutions . their customer service is non-existent . they are not interested in doing what 's best for the homeowner . they are only interested in themselves and gouging the homeowner .
i used to be a daily customer . staff was awesome . now the place is awful . frustrating . .i never go anymore . ever .
i have this place one star , because it ca n't get any lower .
incredibly unprofessional scheduling . i sought a lesson at 1 pm on saturday , was called back shortly before the time , told there was an emergency , which is understandable . the schedule of the same day was pushed to 2:00 , and then pushed to 2:30 .
ughhh i come to this casino often but tonite i must say im very disappointed in my choice ! i ordered the dinner : philly cheese steak , sorry to say that on menu it states its prime rib meat with cheese n onions .
we walked in there and got rude looks from people . the waitress clearly saw us , but did not come by at all . bye felicia !
so expensive ! we received a coupon for $ 25 dollars off our first visit when we moved to the area . i called to inquire about prices . they are extremely overpriced ! 3x o 4x more expensive for same services at other local vets .
third time and never a charm . the first time i had gone here the food was cold but i gave it a second try that time the staff was rude and i was over charged . i tried it again today much to my dismay .
called in for five pizzas and they told me it would be ready in 15 minutes . when i went down there they said they could n't find my order .
they used to be good but now they are n't as good . we ordered bbq pork , mixed fried rice , chili chicken . the pork was ok. rice was alittle bland . the chili chicken was dry no gravy , although we asked for gravy .
i walked in this dry cleaners earlier today to ask about time and pricing on dry cleaning a comforter . the lady proceeded to yell at me and roll her eyes asking well is it a comforter or bed spread ! ? ''
came here to take shower and nap after red eye flight to toronto from los angeles . i guess i had high expectation but . you only get two small towels and they do n't even provide toothbrush .
very upsetting that i downloaded this app as they are similar to uber but have promo codes for new users .
pizza is good . i order the fish for lunch sometimes . it has gotten progressively worse . soggy fries and 1.5 hours delivery times . last time i order here .
if i give a start it is just for the friendly staff working there . the food quality is pretty poor ! the worst tasteless poutine ! i ever tried in montreal !
i purchased the least expensive wash which included some basic wipe down & vacuuming inside car . i then waited as 3 cars were ushered ahead of mine that arrived after i did .
this place is terrible . the small size frost '' is served in dixie cups . it 's too sweet and does n't taste like vanilla . it melts right away and gets super watery . plus , i got a stomachache after eating this .
not worth it . just a handful of cars . the 10 dollars to keep the riff raff out makes no sense . you are kept quite far from the few cars they have . any car show would be more entertaining . really disappointed .
absolutely terrible . the music is loud and distracting , the beer is overpriced , something you do n't find out until you get your bill , because they do n't have anything as obvious as say . a bar menu or price listing . the food is substandard .
the prices are very high for deli sandwiches . you do not get much value for the cost .
this place smells . it 's not a clean store . i love baskin robbins but skip this place . i hope they clean it up .
i came here for a lash lift and it was one of the worst services i have ever spent my money on ! i had to get it done 2 times because the first time my lashes came out uneven , half almost curled and half straight .
we waited over an hour just for a couple of burgers and the food gave my wife food poisoning . i called later to speak to a manager , and was told that the mgr . would call me back .
waste of my time ! i went there on friday and they told me to come on sunday 12pm . i showed up around 12:20pm and waited for 30mins . they are closed ! did n't even bother to contact me about this .
so sad . actually real sad . people having sex by the front door and the staff ok with it march 25 , 2017 - check the security tape . the worst karaoke dj in all az .
after thinking about my experience and reading the other reviews , i believe each person 's experience is based on what race they are and or the type of insurance they have . i notice the bad reviews come from minorities .
got a great rate and had a very pleasant experience receiving the car . on the return , all heck broke loose . the guy who received the car back took out a flashlight and started to inspect the car , writing down 2 smudges ( not scratches ! )
after traveling 1500 miles to move to phoenix , az for a 3 month clinical rotation , i chose to stay my first night at what i thought was a safe and nice hotel .
be careful with this place . i was sent here by my dr . i made my appointment a month in advance gave my insurance information over the phone .
this place got lucky i had to give a star to start writing ! yelp should offer a zero star rating !
tried to go here numerous times but it 's perpetually closed , even during its normal operating hours listed online . it seems the owners just do n't bother opening the business when theyre too hungover to come out on a saturday afternoon .
very disappointed with this shop . i did buy my bridal gown here which was beautiful , but the experience was definitely not what i had hoped for .
clearly the most disgusting and dirtiest walmart i have ever been in . i 'll spend the extra $ $ and go to target . never again !
horrible service. if you can get any ! also do n't expect a tip if i 've been waiting 20 minutes at the bar to order and then have you be a total jerk to me !
i wanted to like this place , as it 's right behind my condo . menu looked great , atmosphere was nice . i ordered a salad . a plain cesar salad . 40 minutes later still nothing . could n't believe it .
this office is so nice just love this doctor unfortunately had to stop going reason being the office manager carol is so rude and harsh has no care in the world for you just makes you feel like your a burden so sad i miss this place
worst service ive ever had ! i walk in the place and no one even greets me . the lady getting her pedicure done had to tell the nail tech that i was there .
it is the worst ever ! i called and emailed and confirmed with them over and over again , they promised they will show up on time . and guess what ? when i entered the chamber on my wedding day , they were nowhere to be found .
i do n't even want to give them 1 star , they deserve ( - ) stars if you ask me ! massage envy is the worst company i have ever dealt with ! fist off my son bought me 3 massages from them for my birthday .
worst customer service at an all you can eat . the waiter did not want to give us a booth because he said he wanted to reserve for a larger party .
this is one of the worst quick care i 've ever been to . the front staff is unfriendly and miserable . i called to make an appointment with the pa but they said there was none to have so just come in .
looks bad from the outside & gets worse when you walk in . rude employees & horrible bedside manner . deserves a zero in my book . if this is healthcare i 'd rather just die !
i honestly do n't know how people eat here . these people leaving nice comments must be friends or families member of the owners . my husband and i ordered take out .
the food was good but the service sucks balls ! if you must go , avoid going when they 're almost closing . they will tell you they 're closed even if you 're trying to finish up your food .
super expensive ! i dropped off 9 garments for same day service , they do n't have set prices per garment so i did n't get a price at the time of drop off . how much could it be ?
another fantastic trip to hm . long line , they allowed some couple to leave there bag as a place in line while they continued to shop . are you kidding me ? i hate this particular store . it 's always a pain in my ass .
to the office- this review is accurate for a surgery i had over 8 years ago and i am more than willing to discuss this review and provide my full name . i emailed and called your office with zero resolution .
came in to do a acrylic nail removal and a manicure . it was quite and only 2 other customers when i came in . the women doing my nails cut my nails too short and almost cut my skin !
horrible , unless you want to wait forever or maybe never get in !
awful show . i had free tickets , glad we did n't pay . we have seen 6 cirque shows and this by far was the worst . save your time and money .
terrible service . i 'm still waiting . and waiting and waiting. , as long as your not hungry and not thirsty it 's an ok place to go
food and services were very good until today , when they made us leave because we were early for the 3-5 pm tea time combo .
the girl ( ca n't remember her name ) thinned my already very thin hair . without asking me . i never said i wanted that . i just think it 's so unprofessional to do something like that without asking . my pony tail feels like string now .
i used to love my car , but now when i drive him i just think of this place . their motto seems to be pay a lot and get crummy work . they are rude and ignorant .
sooooo slow . it took over an hour for a basic pedi . seemed it was the technician 's first time giving a pedicure ever . sad because i hoped this place could be my go-to spot . i wo n't be returning .
it was my first time in the bar so i was n't sure what this place was all about . went to go see a local band play there and when i asked a bartender for a menu , she walked away .
highly disappointed with my experience visiting the salon today . i came here on a groupon deal for $ 17 . i thought , great ! it 's pretty inexpensive , so i 'll give it a shot .
been here a few times . each visit a disappointment . they 're very stingy with the amount of meat in your order and load it up with veggies . nacho chips tasted stale and they 're stingy with the nacho cheese .
beer only . and there 's a lot of beer to pick from . but i just ordered the chicken schnitzel and it came with a steak knife . a steak knife ! it was that tough . if you get hungry ; eat french fries .
not sure why you would n't make it clear ahead of time that the place is going to be closed for 3 days .
i cant begin to comprehend how such a small establishment with only a few empty tables and with two to three occupied tables on a slow friday night can two employees still give such poor customer service .
over priced 150 and up for wigs .
its supper dissapointing . we just to go there cause we have station casino card . and it became our favorite spot for my husbands day off . we loved the happy hour and the food . our favorite bartenders were neil and ian .
terrible service . i have been a customer for a long time because it 's so close to home , and it is because of this specific restaurant that i have built the habit of checking my food before leaving or eating .
this wonderful place did go out of business . when it was open it deserved 5 stars .
best steak ever ! however , the staffed kicked us out after 2 hours , despite our bill being over $ 900 ! we arrived at 5 pm , they kept on walking by to refill our wine even though the glasses were clearly full .
run do n't walk ! this office is horrible ! if only i could give negative stars .
i lived here for one year and that was way too long . the only great things : the pool area , one time a year pool party and a nearby bus stop .
considering all of the great food in the belmont area , i just wish this mcdonald 's would go away . it is a eyesore and a shame that people would eat such unhealthy and processed food with the other great options literally down the road .
rude staff they make fun of customers in there native language and pass dirty comments about girls , the food is all frozen box meat the place sucks !
i took a gown in to have the zipper replaced . the estimation the woman gave me was $ 25 , $ 30 tops . i went back to pick up my gown today and i was really upset that i had to pay $ 55 !
lacking customer service and manners . i 've tried their creations before and was very impressed , and wanted to try using them for my baby shower . upon arrival , they were disorganized , and eventually told me that tastings were for events with 100+ people .
this is the worst grocery store i 've ever been to . if you 're from out of state and trying to buy alcohol do not go here because apparently they ca n't accept out of state ids . that 's the only explanation she would give me .
so if you read my tip about this place you will think i was complaining , but really , there were more employees than customers that night so the level of service was pretty bad given that ratio .
best thing in this menu are the ribs . green beans were mushy , chicken dry , cornbread tasted like it was from a box . overall very disappointing
this is absolutely the worst business , i took a white suit to get cleaned and it came back grey . i 've called about a dozen times and asked for a supervise and there 's never anyone there .
horrible place to throw a party at . they completely ruined a private function with poor service , rudeness to guests and forgetting items . ca n't believe the place is still in business .
do n't waste your time . been a patient at this office for years ( formerly market street dental ) and have watched the service get worse . constant staff change . how can they not keep front office , assistants or hygienists ?
not fresh ! ate here a week ago and thought i would give it a try . i 'm from chicago and was dissatisfied and not happy with the food . never going back and wasting my money . portillos is cheaper and fresh and a chicago institution .
staff has sticky fingers ! keep your valuables close ! a phone was stolen from the countertop in this store by a blonde female staff member , she was very defensive when confronted and attempted to push our business away . sorry lady .
wow , boris , is this your highest level of customer service or what ! thanks for offering to let me bring my items back so you could fix '' the hem that your business failed to do in the first place .
i do n't know why i went to this store the person did n't know how to do his job i would not recommend sprint to anyone
so it was my first time eating here . i ordered delivery , 1 pork souvlaki and 1 chicken souvlaki dinner . for starters when i called i was placed on hold for about 5 minutes .
ordered a steak burrito , came cold on the inside . lettuce is n't a good burrito topping , it 's just cheap .
ordered off of yelp . took 1 hour and 35 minutes for a small plain and wings . pizza was not good . wings were ok .
just terrible food . did n't know where to go for breakfast so we tried this place i have been passing by everyday . i was not expecting much and i was still disappointed ! i order eggs benedict .
spent almost $ 5 on a single butter burger that had a patty so small the bun actually has almost twice as many calories . thank you culver 's for helping renew my commitment to home cooked food .
my husband and i went here with a friend on memorial day . the ambiance was nice and so was the waiter but the food was awful . my husband ordered the free salmon which was a big disappointment : dry , bland and small portion .
i wish i could give zero stars ; please do yourself a service and eat literally anything else , instead . the only redeeming factors were the wine and the slightly more than acceptable fried banana . this restaurant is a celebration of complete mediocrity . if that .
several items are pricy for basic vegetable and meat dishes . my order was completed nearly 20 minutes from start to finish . it was not packed . when i got my order , my wrap was drowning in hummus .
i read all the reviews but stupidly still contacted this center . i made an appointment on zocdoc and then called immediately to confirm . the receptionist confirmed that i had my appointment and was all set .
this family is a disgrace to the art business . if you were to find the names of the artists and google them , each and everyone of them will tell you they will never do business with them again .
horrible service ! waited for over 10 minutes and never got attended .
if you like rich , bland , expensive food this place is perfect . the service is great , but the food was disappointing to the point where i would not even consider going back .
i 'm not sure if you can give no stars ; if that 's possible take my 1 away . gave this car wash a second chance as the fist time a month ago was not a positive experience .
first time here i will never be back again to many people goofing around and i could n't play i told someone in charge but they ignore me i will never be back !
i 've had to deal with this post office twice in my 6 years of living here in az and both times its been horrible . rude employees and horrible customer service .
wow , well done panda express all the reviews said that this location was the worst in the valley . unfortunately for me , i was freaking hungry had not eaten anything all day long .
unfortunately , i 've tried to eat here twice and it was just epic fail both times .
i purchased a vehicle from here in march of 2017 . it was probably one of the easiest car buying experiences i 've ever had . they delivered the car to me at 9pm at night and i did n't spend more than 30 min at the dealership .
i was unhappy with my experience at this store . the salesperson was pushy and manipulative .
this racist bar deleted my review about their racist bartender . lmao ! they deserve 0 stars . i 'll never go to any putters ever again !
i could write a long list of issues i have had with this clinic but really do n't have the time , maybe i 'll do it next time my m.d is an hour late for her shift ( it 's happened for my past two appointments ) .
this place is awful . i used this as back up care through my employer and scheduled 4 days .
my last review was removed , because i included my daughters ' experiences with this shop as well . therefore , i will proceed with my own experiences . i used to go to this shop , for a while .
what an awful place to bowl ! save your money and sanity and go elsewhere . first off the building is disgusting and the ceiling is falling down from rain . talk about a health hazard . second , the price gouging is absolutely atrocious .
if there was a -10 '' on this rating system , that 'd still be too good for them ! do not use them ! we called our insurance roadside service yesterday and this outfit was the one they called .
i guess you get what you pay for . their price was good , but their work was shoddy at best , their customer service skills are lacking , and i finally fired them and will try someone else .
four barbers working . four people getting their hair cut . six people ahead of me . i opened the door to look in , saw how busy it was and proceeded to leave and the owner stopped me saying it was n't busy . so i sat down .
very inexperienced mechanics . worst experience we 've ever had getting car maintenance and repairs . the manager mitch knows even less about servicing cars . also kept saying they were working on the car and i got there and it had n't been touched .
the worst thai restaurant ever . do you guys really know how to make pad thai ? it should n't served microwaved . anything you order from the inside kitchen will be served microwaved .
i will not be using this location ever again ( tenaya way . ) been sitting here for nearly 47 minutes , appt was scheduled for 32 minutes ago , finally called up for check in ( 45 min wait . ) i made an appointment 3 months ago .
this was our first visit , i was excited about a new mexican restaurant in town . what a let down . food was blah . salsa is runny , chips were cold and stale .
nope . nope . nope . the cost was not worth the end result . get ready for this . $ 230 for a wash , dry and curling iron hair style . absolutely no product was put in my hair to maintain a blowout '' .
twelve dollars for a meatball sandwich and you do n't take debit ? what the hell is that ?
do not stay here ! this place is horrendous ! dirty carpets , dirty torn curtains , non-functioning outlets , freezing scalding showers , wrinkled sheets , sandpaper bath towels the size of dish towels , crumbling faux leather desk chair and disgusting comforters and 30 year old blankets .
i will have to concur with most of the latest reviews . freshly is very deceiving when you think your trying out their meal service you are actually signing up for a subscription . i ended up with 6 glorified tv dinners .
this company is terrible . i have a house i own as rental property . i called to get a quote on replacing the patio door .
the sandwiches are meh '' . tasteless lacking salt . over deep fried crap , go to california 's hopefully the . the staff did n't have change for my $ 20 . gave me a bunch of nickels . is this franchised ?
do n't go to this dunkin at all . i called and seconds later the guy that picks up decides to hang up
this has to be the worst airline i have ever traveled on .
this has to be the slowest , most undesirable burger king i have ever visited . the customer service level is the lowest level possible .
i went through the drive thru yesterday afternoon and ordered a 10 piece special . it only took 3-4 minutes for order to be up . i got all the way home and set up on table for my family .
this location keeps running out of things in the middle of the day and does n't tell you . the drive thru has been a slow disaster the last three times i 've tried here .
friendly ? definitely ! competent ? not quite !
the service at this bruegger 's bagels is horrible , the last two times i was there my toasted '' cream cheese bagel was cold ! the customer service was the worse i ever experience at a food place .
do not use this airlines ! no amount of savings is worth the aggravation , lost time and elevate blood pressure this airlines and it 's customer service causes . absolutely a huge waste of time .
very sad , beautiful lake but the marina is below average and the company that runs it could care less . stay as far away as possible if you want to enjoy your time at the lake .
the service was really bad . our waitress even go lectured in front of us by another waitress for taking too long . they did n't refill the water . they have a requirement of a minimum order of $ 25 per person .
was really excited to try this place because wingstop '' is so far away from my house . anywho while ordering my wings i asked for them to be wet '' ( extra saucy ) and i received dry wings .
this location is a joke . i had an appointment for an inspection , simple enough . waited an hour before they even pulled my car into the garage . the guy who was working the front desk had zero customer service skills .
every single time i come to steak 'n shake at the waterfront service is so slow takes at least 5-10 minutes to even have your order taken and than another ten or fifteen for the cashier to ring you out .
when i order a $ 20 prime rib and you have no horse radish , so i ask for a box to take it home uneaten ; maybe give a few dollars off ! i wo n't go back anytime soon .
we stopped by here on the way to shopping . unfortunately , the staff is very unfriendly . the food was sloppily prepared . will not be back .
i stayed for three nights at this awful hotel . every morning my key speed working and they said i was checked out . when i got there i was given keys to someone else 's room .
in response to lori : nickels and dimes , your paddle boats were not in the water , nor mentioned at your recreation desk '' they were parked in the corner of your back parking lot .
came in and ordered a sourdough burger , small onion rings , and a drink from the cashier who could hardly speak understandable english . came out to like $ 12 , and my order was wrong .
nice venue bad service ! there was a bartender named tammy with a tattoo on her arm that was very rude to me and some of the other customers waiting to order drinks .
this place is seriously awful. if you like your car getting hit , roaches in the apartment , weed smokers everywhere , never getting to use the pool , and never being able to park in your spot. move here . i suggest reading the google reviews.
do not go here ! i walked by here a few times and decided to give it a try because i needed a pedicure . the technician sliced into my toe as she was aggressively filing my nails . it started to bleed and she never apologized .
classic bait and switch . quoted me a price . came in to purchase the vehicle and told me they made an error '' in the written quote and increased price by 100+ a month
been waiting for 9 days to hear from them . all i want is email on the london hotel i 'm staying in . they for some reason are unable to reply and get this info . it seems to me like an easy request .
service was slow despite being the only one in the restaurant . waited over 20 min for spring rolls and another 10 for soup to come out which never did i ended up cancelling and leaving .
ordered a bean burrito , which says on the menu comes with beans , rice , and cheese . the not so friendly lady taking my order asked if i would like it plain . unfortunately , my crazy mind assumed plain meant with nothing extra added .
crapy service , and by crapy i mean arrogant , disrespectful and annoying waiters . the place is tiny . the food is average and overpriced . i would n't recommend it to anyone . the music is good though but too crowded to dance . ugh .
so tonight i went to one of my favorite restaurants tonight , only to be disappointed . when i ordered my food i had to keep asking for more because they were giving only half the portion size .
if i can give 0 star , i will ! it was a really bad experience , they checked the smog and said they also do renewal , and would mail the sticker to me , after 2 months ! 2 months , it never came !
ordered hot stone bimbimbap but it was not hot . ordered seafood noodle , and it came with a soup with very few shrimps and mussels .
this f store is horrible . if you truly love your car , do not come here ! they are so mean , and they ask for unnecessary parts and services . i do regret choosing them so badly . they are going to pay for their attitudes someday .
this bank is horrible ! the tellers never count back cash even tho that is there job . i got to this bank for business and personal use because it is convenient . but the tellers do not pay attention .
almost every time i go here , they get the order wrong and the food is stale , the drinks are flat . the manager miguel is very rude and actually told me he did n't care they messed up my order .
worst sprint store ever ! nobody here knows what they are doing . you are better off going to sprint store in tempe marketplace . waste of time . 5 visits to transfer an account ?
if i could rate this store zero stars i would . not only did big o put the wrong size tire on my car in california , the alignment was off because of the wrong size tire .
ordered for valentines day . ya did n't show . got the old probably stuck at a red light '' . an hour later than they were supposed to be there !
really has gone downhill . managers and employees lack good customer service .
do n't use this business ! absolutely the worst customer service i have received . they are neither reliable or dependable . they consistently show up late leave early or do not show up at all . they do not return phone calls or text messages regarding scheduled appointments .
went at 11am on a monday morning with almost no one inside . no on in line and waited 5 minutes before we were eve spoken to . finally started the order and could barely hear the girl taking our order and she spoke so low .
there are people who complain about their order getting messed up . you know what - it 's hard for them to hear the drive-thru speaker box . food gets messed up . it happens . my review is n't based on that though .
i was n't expecting straight out of sicily but how hard could it be to make a pizza and some salad ?
horrible service . lack of people walking around with meat . lack of steak options . unseasoned meat . very overpriced for the quality of food .
i wish i could leave no stars . i worked for this company and they let me go for being too client minded '' which is why i started working there .
if i could give it 0 stars i would . the owner rick was rude and treated me like garbage . he insulted my jewelry calling it cheap trash . '' this coming from a guy with a big gaudy diamond r on his neck .
this driver first went wrong way and then asked for unreasonable amount of money . when i refused to pay the unreasonable charge he claimed , he threatened to call the police .
beware of this service department . we ordered a part ( special order ) and even though we did not take possession of the part , we were charged a hefty 20 restocking fee .
i had them come out to evaluate an ac unit that was not blowing air . the technician ( owner ) said is was a blower motor '' and i needed a new blower motor , bracket and capacitor and the total would be over $ 1200.00 .
consumer beware ! if i could give this place 0 stars i would ! please think twice about taking your vehicle there !
i gave it 2 stars first time around . now that i am once again looking for a facility for my father , i was reminded just how bad this place was for me .
i went to this place on a sunday afternoon for lunch when i was visiting old montreal with my family . to our surprise this place was closed and they did not put up their business hours .
just waited in line for 15 mins for a coffee while the two women behind the counter sauntered around as if no one was even in line ! unbelievably slow service and we finally walked out . get it in gear !
the girl for making appointment on the phone is very very rude . it takes two to three weeks to make an appointment with the doctor . i asked her if she can transfer me to my doctor 's nurse and she refused to do so .
i cringe just thinking about what the kitchen might look like . everything was worth 1 star .
i called in my order and the lady that answered the phone proceeded to tell me that it would take 10 minutes to make my drink . i arrived 10 minutes later , paid for my drink , when i noticed they had n't even made my drink .
above average product . below average customer service and very unclear communications . this is why they are my occasional , but last , choice in printing company .
this place is horrible - bad food , bad service , they have no control over wait times . i 've been here twice - the first time i waited for two hours and the second time waited for 1 1 2 .
my wife went to this restaurant last night and came home astonished by the service . first off , the service was horrible ! i can say i purely blame everything entirely on management ! we waited 30 mins for an appetizer that never came .
this tim hortons is probably the worst . i came at 18 o clock and there was nothing like literally . there was a chocolate donut that i asked , the last one , and the other person just took it , even if i was before this person .
horrible looking cakes and even worse customer service . we bought three cakes and two of them were wrong . they said nobody was there to fix them and they could n't do anything about it .
if you have any self respect do n't spend a dime here . worst customer service on the planet . i literally ca n't keep track of the amount of times they have bold faced lied to me about our trailer .
horrible as a walk-in . was told to call before coming , which i did , to check whether they would still be accepting walk-in patients . told them i would be there at 3:45 .
honestly pretty terrible . i got the half chicken and potatoes rice takeout one evening , and the reheated chicken was unbelievably dry and hard . there might have been one bite of dark meat that resembled chicken . this is the freshest food they have at 7 pm ?
the customer service is awful . every time i walk in , the lady is playing games on her phone . she looks up and seems extremely irritated that i interrupted her candy crush marathon .
we do n't come here very often but this review is due to the second time in a row that our service has been aweful . we walked after 15 minutes of no drink order .
i 'm not sure if the reviews are fake or something but this place had some terrible food . i ordered chicken on the rocks and the chicken was terribly stale and filled with cartilage .
night crew sitting around too lazy to work . why is the open sign on at midnight ? why are posted hours till 1am . bad franchise owner obviously does n't care
avoid at all costs ! ordered for pickup . sat in the restaurant for an hour waiting for a simple order . very slow . when order arrived i went home , opened it up , and found it incorrect .
i will never return ! after being ignored for some time by at least five employees who seemed more interested in chatting up their friends than working , we went across the lot to quaker steak & lube .
greasy , bland , strange flavoured thai food . do n't eat here . a real let down . they need a new chef or at least need a complete makeover to their cooking techniques .
one word - awful . absolutely awful experience . as soon as humanly possible , i will be taking my business elsewhere . in the meantime , i would like to give a shout out to a special '' staff member .
i had the fish fry last sat november 21 , 2014 and got food poisoning . i was there at 830 pm and felt sick about 15 mins after leaving .
do n't ever go to this place ! do n't even try ! they wan na charge you more than other places for no reason while the guy tries to convince you they charge you more because they do a better job ! that 's a joke !
terrible food , little portions i get the feeling by looking around that it 's not the cleanest place in town got a glimpse of the kitchen i wo n't be going back
lena solutions manager - service with an attitude after 40 mins wait . just awful avoid and use another store
the worst mexican food ! and service ! 1st and last time there . food was horrific . rice had to much garlic or condiment and texture was nasty . it seems like they have the dishes ready , but sitting under a hot lamp .
i purchased 25 balloons and had them blown up just over 12 hours before my event was to begin . by the time i needed them , they were deflated and i could not use them .
the cards were cut crooked . the edges were rough and jagged . they were less than forthcoming and helpful about my dissatisfaction , saying that i should allow for them to be crooked . avoid these people .
rental car set up at this airport sucks ! i will not rent in vegas again . waiting over 20 min with a 100 or so folks for shuttles to the rental center . here on business , wo n't make this mistake again . uber
hands-down the worst experience i 've ever had at a dairy queen in my entire life . our two of the employees and management is pathetic and clearly nobody gives a damn
saw the new '' notification and saw some good reviews and potentially tasty food .
very horrible doctor does n't deserve to have his license to practice he treats his patients very badly and his employees even worse i would never recommend this office to anyone i feel bad for the ones that do stay
last minute booking just for a place to sleep tonight . horrible customer service at the front desk . clerk gave us smoking when we requested nonsmoking .
if i could give zero stars i would . the bartender on saturday afternoon 4 29 is horrid . i have never had worse service in my life . we had just left a restaurant where absolut was 6 dollars . it is 8 here .
poor customer service . one sales clerk was sitting on the counter the whole time i was there and since i dropped some items off to sell one clerk made me wait until she helped other customers to help me even though i came first .
its no wonder this place closed . the douche bags who i worked with that owned it , wouldnt pay their bills . no , i am not a disgruntled employee , i was a supplier . if you have to work with or for these a-holes , beware .
i 'm not a member but i 've been to this location several times and this has been my worst experience !
there was a big bug in my drink . they offered me no compensation for the time i had to turn around and go inside the store . they gave us replacement drink and wanted me to shut up so it seemed .
i gave them one star but in my opinion they should not get any stars . i brought a car from them .
this was absolutely the worst indian food i 've had in my entire life and trust me i 've had indian food in at least 14 cities in 5 different countries . the waiter was so rude and demanding .
i switched from cox cable to direct tv . worst mistake ever ! do not get trapped into a 2 year contract . 1 ) the service guy would only set up the direct tv . he redirected my bose sound system to only work with the satellite .
we have tried out this ice cream shop a few times - really hoping we would love it . the cozy old fashioned decor is hard to walk past without wanting a taste . the reviews are misleading .
i would give them -10 stars . this auto shop is complete horse shit . i went in to fix one thing and one thing only . ended up leaving with a whole other problem , that was n't even a problem before i took it there.
i 'm not coming back here . the food was stale and did n't taste good . horrible indian food i ever had . i wish i could give 0 star .
will not be back . owner not very friendly . when we arrived there , about 20 minutes before closing , seemed like the owner was in a hurry . with 15 minutes to go before closing , she started shutting off the lights . very limited selection .
very poor customer service . the waitress barely spoke english and the manager could n't understand our issue well enough to remedy the problem .
good luck getting someone to assist and if they do , please be forewarned that they will be rude and make you want to leave the store immediately . this review is off several visits . i wo n't go back .
horrible ! place is understaffed . press nurses button , at least 20 minutes until nurse arrives . if at all . released my uncle before he was ready . he came back worse than when he was sent there .
if you like awful customer service , delivered with an extremely poor attitude , and by providers who care very little about the quality of their work , then this is the place for you . ask for ashley at the ups shipping counter .
i 've been eating barro 's since 1994 . i 'm sad to say , this location does not have things in order .
we had traveled all over the country by far this was the worst food and service we experienced , the eggplant was 90 breading sauce was very oily , the kid at the register was obvious to taking orders , after $ 20 .
disappointing at best . ribs are tough st louis . the char and sauce were actually good . neither my wife and i could get through some of our ribs . plus he did n't really change the sides . same stuff from carolina .
we 've been to this small restaurant about 6 times , and the last 2 visits were disaster ! the food is great and the menu is huge , but the service , on a scale of 1 to 10 , has become about a minus 4 .
horrible . dirty spots and smudges on outside . none of the floor mats were put back into place . spent 20 min re vacuuming the interior when i got home . tire shine stuff was applied unevenly . did n't put any air freshener in .
i am what i like to think a sushi expert . this restaurant is very dirty . the waitress ' are very rude and they bring you wrong dishes . i once had to wait 15min for wasabi major disappointment !
most of the reviews of this place are from almost 2 years ago which might explain why they are positive . in the last year i have sincerely tried to give this place a shot .
i went in here a few months and it was such a bad experience . i went to get my bangs cut $ 5 that 's it . the hair stylist smelled of smoke as if she just came back from smoking outside .
bouncers here are rude and disrespectful . decided to check this place out last friday night . one of my friends who was not 21 paid the bouncers 40 bucks to get in .
this is the absolute worst , rude , deceptive company i have ever dealt with . i was sent to them by my home warranty company , ahs . this company could care less about customers .
my dining table came today . the glass part of it did n't even fit the frame . their products are crap crap crap crap !
just had dinner at mr chow at caesar in vegas . the food and service was really bad . ordered the noodle which did n't have any flavor and only lukewarm . the filet mignon and chicken were ok only . the service was slow .
worst plumbing service ever ! called them out because water heater is leaking , so guy came out and said need to replace the whole tank for $ 2200 ?
the apartment was big but for the same price you can get a house with at least 200 sqft more . that is probably the only good thing about this place . if you can live somewhere else , do it .
very rude and unprofessional scheduling department for both locations . they canceled 3 appointments due to their inability for not knowing which doctor was covered by my insurance . finally , one months later made appointment with right one . hopefully doctor is better then the scheduling people .
this store is closed . but see reviews of marketplace 42 , which opened up next door to my front porch 's old location .
such a disappointment . unimaginative menu , poor service . lots of business outside , no one inside on a saturday night ? should have been a clue . first visit , last visit . do n't waste your time and money .
promised to do a complete drywall repair with a new piece of drywall , showed up and used putty . i could have done that for $ 10 , but paid them $ 150 when they explicitly promised me they would cut out the old piece and replace it .
forget the comment re beer they no longer have flying monkey just corporate crap beer so if you like frozen food fried or reheated with crap beer and wine go you will love it if you like real food with great craft beer or good wine dont go
i ordered the sirloin steak ( medium rare ) with mashed potatoes and brocoli with a side of garlic bread . bread came out burnt and the sirloin was rare . i had to send it all back .
the experience we had here the other night was abhorrent . it took literally 45 minutes before our waiter would come to table . i kept having to flag down the hostess for service and she kept saying she 'd go get the waiter over and over and nothing .
anyone giving this place more than a 1 star certainly have little to no standard .
when i called , they said they 'll deliver in 5 miles radius but not to my house ( 3.9 miles ) and they said to call another store . lazy assholes
this is my husband 's hair . the whole head of hair is bad , sooo obvious someone chop his hair only with razor and did n't know what the heck she was doing . and the bottom is kissing a big chunk and in even .
purchased 2014 rogue last october - received call from them about coming into look at new car - they wanted mine blah blah blah and they would give me a $ 25 gift card for 25 minutes of my time .
very expensive liquor and a horrible wine selection . a bottle of good vodka or cognac is easily $ 10 or more per bottle . before ownership changed the wine selection was ok now it 's comparable to 7-11 . i hear the food is good however . smh
disgraceful business practices . they routinely schedule appointments with dr. yan at least 35 minutes before he is even scheduled to arrive at the clinic . zero respect for patients .
zero stars . zero stars . zero stars do n't let these a holes touch your car . i had simple labor to replace a crank angle sensor and now my car wo n't complete a drive cycle to pass smog .
apparently this place is great in montreal so was franchised here . it 's very busy and food takes a while to arrive . premium prices are charged for a mediocre breakfast ( the fruit garnish does n't justify the cost of an otherwise average at best breakfast )
aurora has to be the nail salon capital of canada . .there 's so many salons to choose from . this salon recently open so i decided to give it a try . the work done is extremely sloppy and rushed . first , there 's no customers .
this location is the worst ! whether i call in or order online . they never have my order ready . i always leave later , so as to give them plenty of time too ! and my pizza is still under cooked or just soggy !
this place has obviously gotten too busy to care about customer service or repeat business . complete joke . called here numerous times , no calls back ! same as many others have stated in their reviews . girls in the office have the typical ghetto b attitude .
horrible service last night . we will never go back . food was good but nothing special . server had a horrible attitude . for a $ 400 dinner bill we could have had a wonderful experience at so many restaurants in toronto .
sat down and waited at our table for 30 minutes and a waitress still had n't served us or asked for our order or got us drinks . horrible service .
i 've gone to this albertsons for the past 3 years and one in henderson before that . it 's been heartbreaking to see it go from something i look forward to until deciding it 's time to give up on a dying store .
filthy bathrooms , feces on the floor , urine on the seat , paper literally everywhere except the paper towel holders . no soap in the dispensers , sinks covered with litter . disgusting , filthy , dirty , raunchy .
wow been eating here since opening never had service like today . waited in line for at least 5 mins while the passenger in the car in front of me jumped out and started hugging one of the employees .
the guy taking our order was nice . the wait time was more than 15 minutes for two steak and cheese subs , which were n't subs . the philly cheese steak and steak and cheese are switched on the menu .
i do n't honestly know what was worse . the attitude of the old guy making the pizza or the nasty pizza itself . i stopped on my way back to my hotel and thought i 'd give a local business a try .
been here twice . both times was charged for other things that were not the reason for the emergency . they had me waiting 4 hours . they take your dog and look for everything they can charge you . do not come here
i went here for brunch . the food was decent but the service was the worst i 've ever had . they forgot half the things we ordered .
i had the misfortune to try this place last night . the inside is cool and the service was friendly and they have a bar . so go only if you just want drinks . i ordered some fairly simple stuff , miso soup and tuna and salmon sashimi .
dunkin has a card out where you can get a free coffee on monday . i go on monday , ordered my coffee and handed the girl in the drive thru the card .
this place is such a frustration , there is always a policy to something . it is so horrible i hate this place so much . you all can go screw yourself .
this is by far the worst circle k on the face of the planet all of their debit card readers on the gas pumps are out 20 people in line for gas ! i will never shop here again
the employees at this location were very unprofessional and unorganized . i made a reservation weeks before and the day i picked up they gave me a smaller car and it had n't been washed or cleaned .
this location stated that they were too busy for deliveries and suggested a try one of their competitors . really ?
my eyebrows got ruined here and i wo n't be returning . my regular salon was fully booked so i came here after reading great reviews . i left with a burn that took a few days to heal and my eyebrows were visibly different shapes .
thank goodness i received a gift certificate as a gift from last christmas , otherwise i would have been livid . as we speak , she is trying to rush me out of the drying table . mind you , no one is here .
i ordered a philly cheese steak . after reading the ingredients , i noticed they had beer cheese sauce '' instead of melted provolone . i asked them to replace it -- they said they only had swiss .
unfortunately there is no 0 star option , i am forced to select 1 . my mother was admitted at st rose de lima , next door to the restaurant .
ummm . if you 're not open til 11:30am on a sunday , then change the sign on your door which indicates you 're open at 10:30 !
really upset i made a internet purchase for my dog and when i came to pick it up they said was n't ready like really i made that purchase 3 hours ago !
finally decided to give harry buffalo a try after driving past it just about everyday . first impressions were not good , the place was busy there were a few people waiting when we walked in nothing crazy though .
called twice to request visit to review work to be done and estimate - never returned calls . takes more than skill with tools to be a good service provider . it also takes being courteous and responsive to customer calls .
seems to be a common theme with . two scheduled appointments for some electrical work & two no shows . after reading other reviews , looks like i am better off they did n't show up . i would stay away .
i had to go through he drive through . i hate the drive through because i do n't want to be leo gets . well , call me leo ! the girl on the speaker did n't know what a 1 combo was .
do n't ever come here ! i just got off the phone with antonio the manager and he ca n't deliver my tv anymore because i 'm not on the lease of the room i 'm renting in an apartment .
if there were a no star option i would have used it . ten days and counting for a break job and basic axle seal . ten days ! plus , no phone call updates . only talked to them when i called them first . horrible service .
the owners were very unprofessional , and rude . i will never take my children back . there are a lot o way better choices for a preschool
run away ! dump ! sheets have cigarette burns ! worst place i 've ever stayed . i should have read the reviews . the office staff was friendly but the other tenants well where lets just stay rough around the edges .
this place just made the dealerships look good . they forgot to tighten the lug nuts on the passenger rear wheel after a brake job . i came back with only two of five lug nuts .
waited 90 minutes just to get to an exam room , and now still waiting to see the doctor . this is unacceptable , and again , i blame the office manager for failing to properly manage appointments to the standard expected in a modern medical practice .
we ordered nachos and it ended up being that yellow squirt cheese . thinking that management would understand we ask them to redo the order and put real cheese due to an allergy . they had said that they do n't do this .
i will never go back to taffies ever again i set at the counter top for 15 minutes waiting to be served . when i mention it they never seemed to care i walked out and never go back .
had a terrible customer service experience after buying a groupon deal for 4 . called them so many times and left a voicemail and someone got back to me 3 days later .
poor customer service ! they knew nothing about products and would not even assist me .
my daughter and i went in here and had a crazy experience with the owner . after hearing his two cents on every single thing we looked at my daughter asked him about his sign looking for new staff .
barista '' is rude , unhelpful , impolite and needlessly confrontational . i have come to this coffee shop on several occasions to study due to a lack of choice in the surroundings and have seen him more than once yell at customers . excessive prices on certain items .
horrible , incompetent carrier that has absolutely no regard for delivering anything on time . expect lies on lies if you get anything shipped by this carrier . they 'll lie about delivery time and claim packages are delivered to appease amazon 's requirements .
the people were very nice and the bus was comfortable but the tour is way over priced ! i was very upset to find we were not even able to get out of the bus at franklin castle even though they advertise this as their signature attraction '' .
why does it take 10 minutes to get 1 combo meal ? this place needs an overhaul . there 's no organization whatsoever .
the person is just plain rude . she was yelling at me for my asking what 's her average price for a hair length and texture like mine . wanting to estimate your cost prior to getting the service is something you should not ask for ?
bad service . do n't waste your time . it would be better to do it yourself than bring your car here .
the one test i needed run , they did n't even bother to run it . then did n't bother to tell me they did n't run it . they just called and said all your test results are fine . no . i 'm not fine .
the guy who was serving when i asked for hot water for my tea was very rude to me , only to find out that he is the manager of this location . his name is chris .
i do not like this place at all ! i got food poisoning from their soup ! the milk in the soup had gone bad ! i do not trust this place at all !
i received an ipad when i purchased my car but it was n't what i wanted . i called apple store sherway to find out if i could upgrade it .
went in to pick up a few cigars . they have a smaller selection compared to larger cities , but after about 15 minutes i 'd found substitutes for everything i was looking for .
definitely one of the not-so-good '' locations i 've been to . not recommending this place , try another subway .
out shopping & decided to see what this place had to offer because i 'm new to the area . there is a sign that says no large bags . that 's fine because today i have my tiny , cross body purse . cool .
i had the pork katsu curry a week ago and it was awesome . i was told it was homemade and it tasted homemade . when i visited today and ordered the same thing , what came out was not the same thing which i ate a week before .
horrible experience ! they actually banned me from seeing my doctor because i questioned my daughters bill . i made her appointment to get on birth control , and they turned it around and coded it an ob gyn so insurance would n't pay .
absolute worst company to ever do business with ! do not trust them with your valuables , your money , or your time ! they are misleading , unprofessional , unreliable , rude , and i will be reporting my experience to the better business bureau .
this place has changed hands since my last review , and things went downhill fast after that . while the menu is the same , the people cooking are not doing a good job . the food is heavy and way too greasy .
this place should be called china 9 wan wan . this place was awful . after reading all the reviews i thought i would give them a try . bad mistake , we ordered the pad thai and egg foo young both were absolutely awful .
horrible gas service ! never come here for gas the pump poured gas all over the car and wo n't refund the money and they told us to tow away the car or told us to move it horrible never coming here again . and also called the fire department
went in with my fiance for wedding invitations and was helped by the lady with the boy cut hair cut . i felt rushed and the lady made me feel like i was taking up her time . she was rude to my fiance .
we just ate here with our family and the food was ok .
if there was a number below 1 i would give it . this show was terrible . not only did the cast never live through the 80s , they did not bother to research the time period .
i will do anything or use any excuse not to go to this place . i hate dealing with all the people here and the staff . if i wanted to be judged , i would rather go to church .
i should have known better than to order breakfast at a pizza joint . burrito was cold and had egg shell pieces . they had a big pan of scrambled eggs that they scoop eggs out of and reheat . should have waited until las vegas to eat .
ugh . the thought of entering this walmart makes my gag reflex get a little jumpy . when i use to go it was because i needed something that target did n't carry , that does n't happen any more .
the worst dominos in las vegas . constantly screwing up my order . the real complaint is when you ask them to fix the order . they look at you crossed eyed and then become nasty . go somewhere that values your business and makes food properly .
very sloppy ! no attention the polish is all over my fingers so disappointing and aggravating that now i 'm going to have to pay more money else where to get them redone
i never thought i would review a place and award it 1 star , but fresh choice deserves it . i went into this local food store last year to buy some fruit as their selection of fruit and veg outside their store looked tempting and mouth watering .
followed the advice of yelp and went . this place is closed with no indication that it might open up again . i want my 22 minutes back .
decent enough pizza , but the first ( and last ) time we ordered from there , the pizza guy went to the wrong house , even though i was standing outside with money and made eye contact with him .
i usually come here for the salad bar and the iced tea .
no massage with your pedicure i even paid and extra $ 5 for a salt scrub and still no massage . never coming back .
my sister in law and i were both getting married in 2010 . ( my sister in law in may and myself in july ) and we went with my mother in law to davids bridal in strongsville sometime in 2009 to just look at dresses .
this is the most unethical company i 've ever been foolish enough to do business with . they were once called freedom air conditioning and still use the same phone number .
after so many great reviews , i tried calling but the voicemail was not setup '' . so i emailed with no response . .i am writing this 2 weeks later and have still not heard anything .
this place is awful . if there was a zero star option available , i would confidently select that . i visited this business '' yesterday evening and ordered a carne asada burrito in the drive-thru . i got home and the burrito was super salty .
office staff is worthless . after i moved out of arizona , i spent months trying to get them to transfer my records ( which they are required by law to do ) so that i could continue the medications i was taking .
why do you have to pick one star ? they are not even 1 star . will never use again . i tried calling them and held for over 30 min then put in my phone for them to call me back and still after 2 days no call .
was never able to get ahold of anyone one the phone . i was told it was not possible for me to cancel my appointment , only reschedule . sent me a bill for a penny which could not be paid online . there is nothing convenient here .
the dirtiest subway i have ever been to . i hope i do n't get sick . i was the only one there while the guy working here was just in back talking on the phone instead of cleaning .
3 31 17- great food ! however , while eating my teriyaki bowl , i almost broke a tooth on a shard of glass . it looked just like the onions , so i did n't see it . glad i did n't swallow the glass .
food is good when they get your order right . customer service is awful ! i used to be a regular customer , but thet last four times my order was wrong and they did nothing to fix it . the girl just said oh well maybe next time .
it 's a very disappointed place ! they do not accept credit card , or debit card without a chip . as a visitor from u.s , we do n't have any cash either . so we have to pay us dollars .
food is overpriced but very poor quality . chicken was reused from morning an lamb was old and not properly cooked . i would not recommend this place for the money . buffet is $ 19 which covers only basic items
the food here is pretty good when they actually have what you want on the menu , but the service is terrible .
i went to have a few drinks while my boyfriend sang a few karaoke songs and had to beg when ordering drinks .
dropped to a one star review for shitty business practices and hiring shady bastards at the register .
this was by far the worst mani pedi i have ever had ! unprofessional staff and salon dirty salon is just a small portion of the horrible experience .
we were sat at 9:15 . dinner arrived at 10:45 . those of us not drinking wine were not offered anything other than water . once dinner arrived a couple of the steaks were placed in front of the wrong patrons .
really bad menu and certainly does n't match the interior and scene of the restaurant . service took forever and the cost is way too high for the food . we got the veggie kebob . could have made it at home for less than $ 12 !
i hardly dislike any cafe . this one is too small too noisy and too many things to complain about . went here for a coffee . shocked by how small it was . i could n't take out because i ordered a macchiato .
just tried to buy my puppies food here ( i normally go to the location by the i 17 freeway ) they only had one bag & that bag expired 3 months ago ! check your dates !
i 've eaten at this restaurant many times and have loved it , but this last time is the worst ! the food here has gradually gone down hill . i spent way too much for the dried out poor quality i received ! what the heck happened ?
disappointing . food was mediocre and the waiter knew nothing about the wines . they left my wine at the table while i was in the restroom . the interior needs some serious updating as well .
ordered take out the other day . i 'm not a huge swiss chalet fan but it 's nearby . i ordered the kids chicken tenders and they were so hard and full of batter . it definitely was n't fresh .
if you come here , unruly groups of young adults will ruin every single moment of it . better off driving further to another movie theater or just waiting to rent it . seriously .
do not go here ! we came here for persian new year , and we regret it . my family came here from michigan and while eating dinner a pot light fell on my cousins head and cut his eye open .
tlc sent tony out to take photos and assess the damage to my roof . they never got back to me with an estimate . i called them back and they said they would look for the proposal and call me back . they did n't .
they can not include straws in the drive thru with two drinks and a frosty ? really ? unfortunately , we realized this after we were turned going south on stephanie , going home to anthem .
this was my first time going to this place just see if it there 's was something different about this one .
if i could give a zero star rating , i would . horrible service from this place with sub standard quality food . the owner gary is a joke so it 's no wonder that the rest of his staff has no understanding of guest service .
this seems to be the call center address - could be mistaken .
this is a convenient location , but not a great coffee shop . some of the staff is good , but , at best , the place is mediocre . in my opinion , the ownership does not care about the quality of the coffee .
warning - do not consign here ! i had items disappear '' and the couple took no responsibility and showed no compassion . they treat customers and consignors terribly . save your time , money , and items for a better business !
i ordered a pizza at 9:45 and it got to my house at 10:30 , but that 's not why i 'm upset . our pizza was great , our cheesy bread was burnt .
love dunkin donuts but not this location ! outside patio a mess . trash cans full . employees not friendly at all !
this company is a joke .
this might be the worst burger king on the whole planet ! took them 12 minutes to make 2 hot dogs , i came inside the all the tables were filthy i had to clean it myself , the girls behind the counter were rude !
rating : based primarily on service . definitely not good for large groups ! came here for a wake , with reservations for 4 tables full of relatives . i found that most of the servers were quite rude .
by far the worse . cucumbers where bad , tacos tasted so weird i almost threw up ! nothing is fresh or has taste . will never come back !
no public restroom . i 'm sorry , but a restaurant with no restrooms should not be allowed to operate . it 's insane and there are no other businesses in the area with restrooms so you 're out of luck if you have to go .
stay away ! they showed me an apartment , told me the rental rate , and then once i paid for the credit check and made the non-refundable deposit , they changed the price to $ 200 higher per month .
they are beyond horrible . one star is being generous i really wish my insurance would let us go elsewhere .
austin , is rude and does n't seem to care about general manners . i walked in and was heading to the back for a soda and this punk austin nearly ran into me & then proceeded to act as if i was in his way .
be advised now called jackson 's : have taken my vehicles there repeatedly over years .
i went here at 3 pm between the lunch rush and the dinner rush , and the restaurant was maybe 20 full . i ordered the chili mac supreme to go . i thought i would be in and out within 5-10 minutes .
food need a revamp , it looks like a mess and taste bland . shame , because moroccan food is full of flavor , this restaurant used to be great few years ago , now it 's all about belly dancing and liquor . too bad .
let me just state that coming from chicago we had high expectations . we also were very disappointed . now i can understand that not every hot dog that claims to be a chicago dog comes with the neon green relish .
this place sucks ! they would n't honor a gift certificate and refused to provide a refund until i threatened to report them to the better business bureau ! whatever happened to customer service ? how they stay in business in this horrible shop is beyond me !
horrible horrible ! i received my couch a month later and only because i kept calling !
wow what a shambles of a company . called three days before to make sure my car was reserved and was assured everything was fine . i was a bit concerned because i knew this lot was a bit aways from the airport and would require a shuttle .
if i could give this negative stars i would . the only upside was the manager did call me about my horrific experience . the girl that did my brazilian , a . did not even introduce herself b .
i 've been a gentle dental customer for about 12 years . i 'm afraid i must leave them . their customer service has really gone down . i once waited at their office for 45 minutes after my scheduled appointment time .
came in for a certain product and it was sold out .
the course itself is a great course .
went in for a notary signature . the notary , jim , marked up my document without my permission . he started crossing out fields which needed to be there . he realized his mistake then provided no help to print me a clean document .
arrived at the store walked in and jokingly said i would take 36 of your $ 5 pepperoni pizzas . the tattooed girl behind the counter then motioned & verbally invited me out the door .
pro : - attentive wait staff . granted , i was one of the two customer there . - sugary , buttery , and most unauthentic sweet balls that i 've ever tasted , and it 's warm too .
i wish i would of read the reviews b4 i wasted my money on a groupon .
i went here on my break from work to get dinner . got an 8 ' italian sub . it was messy but tasted good .
i will give one star for being open . i purchased a chicken biscuit this morning from the drive through . when i arrived at work and ate my biscuit i was very disappointed to say the least .
wow , worst wait ever . went there at 3 am and waited in the drive through for 25 mins .
this place is just bs . went there and asked specific for the poutine burger without bacon . waited 15min it was night time and i was in the car when i was about to eat i saw the bacon like wth i asked for without bacon .
came here for a breakfast burrito and coffee for a morning flight . coffee was passable but i ca n't comment on the burrito .
i took my dog here for several months and noticed he would get sick . one day he had obvious skin problems that was visually noticeable and the staff never questioned it .
walk in is not correct for they book the whole day . doctor is not on site all day like they say . so not happy with this location .
utterly racist dress code , egregious . the bouncers are also racist , kicking out black people more than whites .
do n't come here unless you want your perfect paint on your nice car scratched . they will not take responsibility for the damage they did nor will they do anything to compensate you . they will tell you a rock scratched your car .
i just ordered from here for the first time using yelp . i wanted to surprise my husband because i had been in the hospital and hes been taking care of me full-time for a week .
while i really love the food here , i called in a to go order as i was on my way to work and when i got there the cook had been chatting with someone at a table and my order was not made .
i ordered a salad at this restaurant and the employee at the salad station was very slow and chewing gum the whole time . another employee at checkout never said thank you .
omg bad service ! this review is for the walk-up window only . went here last night which was a saturday . my bestie and eyed the piña colada machine and decided to get one to share .
when i saw this place i was so excited to have some soul food near by . unfortunately , i was very disappointed . i order the fried catfish and was disappointed . it was just okay .
horrible ! what a dump ! none of the ice machines worked . the toilet ran every 10 minutes all night long !
i really wanted to like this place . but the food was horrible .
just had the worst customer experience at this hotel !
this is probably the worst haircut i have ever gotten .
i used to enjoy going to the dark horse definitely a cool atmosphere but the last couple times i have been the service has been so bad that i refuse to go in again .
ok property was nice but every time i needed to deal with the ladies in the office i had to talk with a new girl . the staff is never the same .
i was surprised to find out that they do not accept anything but cash so i then went to get cash and left my suit at their establishment . i picked my suit up and tried it on and it fit wonderfully .
elitist snobs . it was 8am . there 's about 6 people behind the counter and only 1 cashier . i was patiently waiting for this 1 cashier to get her act together with everyone else . then they finally open another register .
been here a few times with no issue and today i 'm convinced they are trying to run some kind of racket .
let 's just cut to the chase : do n't come here . overpriced , awful food , and the absolute worst service i 've had in recent memory -- and that is n't hyperbole .
i really wanted to choose .5 or 1 4 of a star . the table was wiped with a dirty rag or something which left the table stained with leftover food from the previous patrons .
absolutely lousy service , and really expensive . the security guard was the only professional in the place .
let me start off by saying that i would give them 0 star . my order at this restaurant is pretty clear : veggie pizza . i remember back in the day their pizza was not bad compare to other persian pizza places .
i came in an hour before closing . there were two people in front of me . took them 1hr and 45 min just to see me . mind you , i 'm in a tremendous amount of pain .
i went through the website to rent a car because i had totaled mine & was stuck at a body shop about 30 minutes from home . i called to confirm & was on hold over 10 minutes .
stopped in for breakfast 07 26 2015 , owner said we 're not open . just having a going away ceremony . '' contrary to other reviews , he was quite pleasant with us . however , it had the feel like he was going out of business .
c'mon guys there is 10 people in line and only one register open . the manager and four sales people on the floor gathered laughing and joking while we are staring at them waiting . there is no service that the other reviewer spoke of .
i have been here a few times and have been pleased with the service . vladimir is great and a pleasure to talk to . yesterday however they were pretty busy and vladimir was unavailable to cut my hair . the woman working with him yesterday did it .
had a horrible experience with this company a few months ago . my story sounds very similar to the ones posted on here already . incredibly lousy customer service and an owner who could give a damn about filling orders and delivering service .
one of the worst places i have been in my life . the decor is tacky and played out . it has the smell and feel of being in a basement . oh wait you are !
went the other day for lunch and the lady at the deli was extremely rude . definitely not going back
really dissapointing . i went in for carry out ( was just hoping to get a bahn mi sandwich ) . i waited almost 20 minutes and felt that the lady that took my order could have cared less that i was there - she was cold .
hokkaido had been functional sushi , at best . it 's one of two sushi options in this area of town , so i have frequented mostly out of convenience . never memorable . however , today was entirely horrible . i had the lunch menu with chicken teriyaki .
we ordered a complete kitchen from them and getting good customer service has been like pulling teeth . they were late on the initial install - only under threat did they get it in on time . 9 months later we are still waiting for pieces to be installed .
the bathroom had cigarette ashes shoved behind the door , 1 towel , 25 of a toilet paper roll , dark reddish brown stains on the tub , a broken drain just sitting in the tub , and a hole in the door .
i absolutely love town hall 's drinks and food and is one of my favorite eateries . unfortunately , today i am having a severe reaction to a nut right now . i called them to find out more information and they really did not care .
the staff was horrible here . i will drive a extra 3 miles to go to another kfc then to go to this one .
i got my tattoos back in july , and to my dismay i was what the doctor explained as over worked '' half of the tattoo is a raised scar which is a pain to look at .
really rude and inattentive staff . i swear the people working here are high or something ( which i normally do n't mind , but do n't do it at work . it 's just annoying . )
been here a few times and honestly the service is not worth driving there . seems like the employees are disgruntled and unhappy with their jobs . support good businesses with your hard earned money if its something you care about and check other shipping stores nearby . peace .
that was just weak . unimpressive stunts and a story written for children . i am amazed at how people can be impressed by this show . extremely slow , boring and poor acrobatics . to be honest it looked more like stiff legged power rangers doing warm ups .
ordered online for pickup . order was almost 15 minutes past pickup time . not because they were busy , was only 2 in store customers with food , and 1 pickup . once all ready i was given 3 entrees when i purchased 4 .
absolutely awful ! if yelp on my phone would let me do zero stars that is what this place deserves . they totally butchered a grooming on my 7 month old goldendoodle .
purchased a bag today and there was no mention until i looked at my receipt in the car that refunds were not accepted . i ca n't believe it . it seems illegal to do this and not inform the client when selling them a $ 5000 bag .
we went for sunday lunch based on reports that they had a good lunch menu . when we got there we discovered that you can only order from their dinner menu sundays . the good news is that the staff is very friendly .
another horrible experience . after a long week it was pizza friday ( supposed to be followed by a ! but tonight is was : ( ) instead we were delivered the wrong pizza .
check-in was friendly and appt was on time . lisa gave me the worst mammogram ever . she treated me in a rough way that made me feel violated all day . she should be doing foot xrays not working with women in a personal and vulnerable state .
came here based on other reviews about great food and great happy hour . this review is specific to happy hour which has left me disappointed . drinks are half price which is nice but i can drink at home cheaper .
i made the mistake of not getting a receipt upon returning a car last time , well ahead of the return time . they decided to overcharge me a full day saying i returned it late - scam .
the food is great but i have problems every time i go to this location . service is very poor . i will not be going to this location any longer i leave upset every time .
not only the slowest starbucks , but they were out of every food item i asked for . horrible when you 're sent on an office run and you do n't know the alternatives your coworkers will like .
worst mistake i ever made using this jackass . thought he was doing what we hired him to do for several businesses we had . years later we started getting notices from the irs for things he either did n't file correctly , or did n't file at all .
the absolute worst steinberg i 've been to yet ! and that 's saying something . staff is difficult and rude ! first and last visit to this location .
several of us eat here once or twice a month , lunch or dinner . we have taken this place off our list . filthy dirty bathrooms , walls and tables .
be very careful ! this company will sell you the world then start building your website and every other day will come to ask for more and more money . they use old and outdated servers .
came in for the brunch menu . food took very long to arrive , and was cold ( filet mignon eggs benedict ) . an utterly unsatisfying experience .
the food was decent , the prices were alright ( for vegas ) , but the service was terrible !
well as i predicted in my first review for this place , it did not last .
stop calling me . i bought a car from another dealership . literally 27 calls from this dealership is 13 days . everything from sales people to surveys about the sales calls . just stop .
i have been to this urgent care before and have the same medical insurance and have always paid my balance in full .
food was overcooked and service was horrible . would not recommend to anyone . only positive was they offer military discount .
walked in , walked right out . the guy had closed everything up half hour before store hours posted , was cleaning and clearly pissed we walked in . we are currently eating at culver 's where we decided to go across town .
the food is horrible . the service is horrible . the dessert is horrible . i want to write something nice but it has absolutely nothing positive for me to write about .
i have been going to this wash with both of my vehicles for 13 years .
these people do an ok job , but overcharge for the quality that you get . they are very sneaky and will always try to up-sell '' you by saying that you need additional repairs to your shoes . do n't buy into it , use your judgment .
you can tell they use powder mixes due to the grit texture . prefer drinks that use a liquid mix . always and i do mean it 's always busy from what i 've seen while on my way to starbucks which is good for them .
stay away from the serene location unless you like extremely rude employees . i wish i had read the other reviews before i went there for jewelry repair . do yourself a favor , go to another jewelry store even if it is much further away .
not gluten free friendly . the gluten free options of chocolates desserts are hugely lacking . also no consideration for 65 of population that is lactose intolerant to some degree .
have been here a few times . never anything too bad , but not that great , either . ordered red curry take out tonight ( substituted broccoli for green beans ) and it was almost entirely bamboo shoots .
these are the worst apartments i have lived at ! the staff is rude and disrespectful . you walk into the office and everyone looks like they hate life . it takes maintance up to a week to fix anything . there was mold behind the appliances .
save your money ! talk about a shady business . the owners continually write the teachers bad checks . i guess i think people need to know this . i know a few really great teachers who left because of this . i stopped attending classes here on principle .
garlic naan is very good and that 's about it . service was extremely unfriendly and made me feel very unwelcome by debbie s. granted she was covering a few tables but she was extremely rude .
selling me a tv ad while you 're selling me gas ? that 's a new low . especially because i have to wait for the stupid thing to finish before i can print a receipt .
poor customer service ! if i come in at 11:05 o should still b able to get food . i 'm the customer .
we just moved to scottsdale and were looking to get a pizza . staff was not friendly to begin with . we decided on a bbq chicken pizza . the worst pizza we 've ever eaten .
the food is just meh . not worth the price . their chicken , pasta , soup and salad were not worth the gas money . service can be spotty from poor to average . i think they lost their good waiters in the past because of bad management .
their customer service reps are always nice , but their drivers are terrible . i ca n't tell you how many times i have asked them to stop leaving the bins in my driveway .
this has to be one of the worst company 's to deal with they have tried to tow my car out of the community i live in 4 times illegally in the past 3 weeks saying my car was not current on my registration .
all of my culture pass issues were taken care of by contacting act one directly . they have called and explained to amanda , and hopefully all other employees of this branch , how a culture pass works .
over priced frames . terrible customer service ! i took my mom here for mother 's day as all she wanted was an eye exam and a pair of glasses .
worst service ever . ordered a buffalo chicken salad and when i bit into my chicken it was rubbery and raw . i then told the waitress my issue and she took the plate from me .
avoid . bartenders and servers were doing shots in the kitchen . granted is was new year 's eve but only 3pm . slow service because of this .
will never buy a car from this dealership . united nissan is the worst dealership in las vegas and has horrible customer service skills . i finally want to buy a car so decide to go with nissan .
really need to stop coming here , they take forever to even acknowledge you , then spend forever taking care of drive . i know they are probably timed but just because i am inside does n't mean i have time to wait forever .
it has to be one of the worst managed mcdonald 's , if not the worst . i ca n't even imagine how the owner or investors do n't know this ! i spend 25 minutes in the drive through to only get cold food .
this place was a joke ! a waste of time and money . unfriendly staff . limited selection of food for a buffet . food served cold . crab legs were thin and tasteless . everything about this place was horrible .
i decided to give them a try as they seem to be a new company . i should have saved my money and called someone else . lots was missed including a spill on the counter , counters not even wiped down , and no attention to detail .
my mom order a cake for my sons 2 nd birthday . the decoration was impressive . the cake was disgusting . i was embarrassed and was so grateful i had made a ton of cupcakes because there was no way i could serve that cake to the guest .
i usually like aladdin 's , but this one was awful ! the 2 of us came later in the afternoon to get a quick meal . the waitress was newer and they gave her 6 tables . no one else was helping her .
service is unbelievably slow ! my wife and i stopped in with our kids . assuming that since we were the only party ordering food we would see a quick turnaround time from order to food on the table . not so .
drive thru order . sarah was nice , but got home and found burnt af chicken ! super disappointing . i tried to call right away and the phone number is a california area code that does not answer . probably would just go somewhere else in the future .
they specifically asked what dipping sauce i wanted . then did n't give me anything . get it together .
i had dinner here last night . the bartender was really nice , but slow , lacked good timing on serving drinks and the bar had the worse beer selection quite possibly in vegas .
so disappointing ! do not , i repeat , do not buy premium tickets from half off booths ! we thought we were going to get great seats surrounding '' the stage but ended up with the last row on the balcony !
was really excited to find a shaved ice place in the nw , but very disappointed to get there and find that they have no sugar free syrups . really ? not one ? way to alienate a huge chunk of the population that is diabetic .
please do yourself a favor and never rent from this establishment . they unfairly accused us of causing damage to the van we rented , and we know we never caused the damage .
not the best food for mexican . went and ordered three rolled tacos with guacamole on the side . the guy takes my order and starts making my order right after , did n't even bother to wash his hands !
i vote time warner cable the worst company of all times . i spent 30 minutes on hold tonight trying to find out why my bill has gone from 29.99 to 55.00 per month and i can not see any change in the quality of service .
the mobile department is terrible and unbelievably lazy . you 'd be wise to drive down the interstate to the macedonia best buy .
this location sucks ! we were the only people in line , yet we sat for 27 minutes waiting for our mini quesadilla 's . 27 minutes ? really ?
probably the most disgusting sushi i ever had in my life .
pretty much the worst place to eat in uiuc . bad customer service , terrible employees . talk more than they work , does n't seem to care about anyone who walks in .
food is ok. service is shitty . i was trying to figure out where to order for about 5 minutes . i was not greeted or asked for help .
we visited their showroom three times and got the worst customer service each time .
if you want to watch your car roll off of the tow truck and into a wall , call central towing . i am serious .
i went in when it was not busy , and was completely ignored . there were a few people at the bar getting attention , but the two staff people purposely did not acknowledge my presence . after about ten minutes i left .
do n't bring your car , because if it gets hit by a cart they will be unconcerned , unhelpful , and unwilling to help do anything about it or less you in the direction of getting the situation handled .
worst service on the planet . worst . worst . worst . worst . worst . i got in on a later flight and needed to get something quick before going out and i was staying at the mirage .
this place is awful ! waited 1 hour for the doctor on our first visit . yet i show up 5 minutes late due to traffic and they refused to see me .
nasty . nasty . nasty . nasty . nasty . nasty . how about this yet a rag , a bucket of soapy hot water , a fresh mop bucket and scrub the tables the floors , under the tables , the walls , the seats .
i ordered a thai tea that was mainly 95 ice . once i finished my drink , the server took the cup . he then returned with water '' which was literally the same thai tea cup with added tap . it was the most disgusting thing ever .
slow people , damaged nissan versa with a weird rattling noise that sounds like a flat tire while driving , spilled coffee and stains on the car seats , what else do i need to say ?
i 've been receiving botox injections for years , and until now 20 units would last approximately 4+ months . they were running a special in december that was 30 less then what i was paying , so i jumped on the opportunity to save a little money .
i waited several months to write to perhaps gain a different perspective on our experience with this place . i still have the same opinion . there was unprofessional and bizarre service starting from visit two for my son and i .
i am a die hard broncos fan and this is a raiders bar . it has black and orange harley davidson colors on the outside and all black and silver on the inside . the beer mug was cold but the beer tastes warm .
brio was legitimately me and my wife leah 's absolute favorite brunch for the angel hair frittata . we are so disappointed to see that it was removed from the menu . seriously ? ca n't believe it !
the company was good to start out with , i even gave the driver a tip for carrying the a c upstairs .
false advertising . walked in well before 9pm on a tuesday , despite being open till 10:00 the hostess waitress had to check if the kitchen was still open . for real ? apparently customer service is not a priority .
we used to regularly frequent on tap & always had a good experience . it had been awhile & even after reading some current bad reviews , we decided to go there . my first clue should have been the almost empty parking lot at 6pm on fri .
edit i went in and it was 5 minutes before they opened and the bartender , she said we 're not open and made me leave and wait outside for 5 minutes before going back inside .
i test drove a car on wednesday , did n't make a deal . on thursday , was emailing back and forth with justin , the internet sales person , and worked out a deal and i was to arrive a few hours later .
there is one asian lady behind a window when you walk in . there is nothing posted about their rates , requirements to get a loan , or anything . apparently you have to a local bank account .
every single time i fly into las vegas the worse issue to deal with is the airport . u got some power tripping tsa people working here . one person says 1 thing , another person says another .
stopped in the store on saturday , they did n't have what i wanted in house but said the had one in tempe and could have it by tuesday ; i said i wanted to see if someone had it in house and would get back to him .
great hot wings but the service and entrees were horrid . the fries came with so much raw garlic they were in edible . poorly cooked chicken -- was dry and nasty . server was not helpful .
pho was excellent ! service was terrible ! waiters looked unprofessional and uninterested in their customers . never greeted upon arrival and no one ever checked in once my food arrived . never got asked if i wanted a drink ?
still waiting after an hour , called early morning said it was ready ! well they started working on it when i arrived . kept telling me it was on way up instead of telling me the truth . should have just said can u come back later !
went for breakfast today what a disappointment . seated fairly fast but waited around 10 minutes for the waitress to stop and take our order . around an hour after arrival we still had not received our food although people that arrived after us were eating .
the cheyenne saloon is no more ! it has been sold . it has been renamed adrenaline sports bar and grill . new sign should be up soon . and cheaper drink prices as well .
over priced . nothing made in america . made in china . poor quality clothes for dolls and nothing a little girl would actually wear that matches her doll . we had very high expectations and were really let down .
do not go here ! they used to have a girl that was fantastic . i was getting great results with no pain . i went for my final treatment yesterday and someone else did it .
if i could give less than 1 star i would . just went to pick some new clothes up for my kids after our online order got cancelled and we were not notified .
i got a response that they wanted to look into this further , yet the website they gave me was bogus . boy this place just keeps getting better and better with it 's customer service '' not !
first and last time for me ! i went in planning to eat dinner , have drinks with a friend , and watch a blues jam . we sat at a table in front of the bar from 6:50 till 7:45 .
love the price of cigarettes , but as soon as i walked in the door an older women workin there stairs at me then walks up asks me for i 'd so i went to hand it to her and she snatched it out of my hand .
wow , this place is terrible . even worse than the old aka teppan place that i only tried once and never went back . everything is oily and the ingredients are all of extremely low quality .
you would think that after all the negative reviews posted the staff would up their game and make nice to the customers . not the case , and if possible the woman who does the consignment intake is even more sour than the past .
i was told i did not bring in a pair of $ 300 jeans . so i refused to leave . about 10 minutes later after swearing she did not have my jeans she returned from the back with them . i do not recommend this business .
i was going there for a while , trying different people but getting same thing done . when it came to paying i was charge differently all the time did n't make sense . they also charge extra for everything !
bought groupon - scheduled appointment - showed up on time and no one was there ! beware - might be a scam !
their technicians makes false claims so that your home warranty wo n't cover the claims . they do that to sell their own brand new ac unit to make money from you . it 's a scam , beware of this company .
this service came recommended , as i have n't used a cleaning service before . i am very disappointed . one person came to clean and was there for 9 hours . i needed a move out cleaning .
horrible service , i went to do service for shipping , they told me do it by yourself at that computer .
i totally agree with marcus p. they ruined my teeth 4 years ago . now i have to spend big bucks to get implants .
some of the rudest service i 've ever gotten . glad my order was n't more complicated than a cup of coffee . at least she did n't throw the coffee in my face , but that is my only positive .
just bought a puppy from them and she has kennel cough and parasites ! they must not take care of their puppies . buyer beware !
the banfield pet hospital that petsmart provides is the absolute worst place you can take your pet . after my first bad experience i thought i would give them a second chance and i ca n't believe they had the audacity to be rude and hostile again !
the place is fine however their business practices are anything but honest . when i went to this place first time , i enquired about their 50 off offer but they said they have stopped offering it now .
no taste and super expensive , they claim their hot dogs are rolled in bacon i never tasted the bacon very disappointed
anytime i have ordered from this location there is always an issue . forgotten items or they are out of the item and only inform me upon delivering , after they have processed the charge on my card .
i wish i could give zero stars . i have been a loyal customer for years and now there is a new manager who is completely terrible .
rude and horrible service - plus food is just so so . find another location .
the only positive thing about this place is seeing the country singers perform . the staff is extremely pretentious and rude .
what a waste of gas and time ! i got a cranberry manicure and pedicure via groupon .
this place sucks ! i know several people who have walked out on their bill because they had to ask for it 4 times and it still never came . the service is the worst part about this place . wish i could give a negative rating .
el santo now closed as of may 16th . pool is drained and no further business according to maricopa health commission .
terrible service ! it took 20 min just to get a glass of water and there were less than 10 people in the whole restaurant ? i guess its safe to say that i wont be going back
they suck ! pt 's charged me for drinks while i was playing video poker for $ 1 per hand . it 's an off strip dump so you would think they would want to attract people with deals , drinks , food etc .
terrible service to first time customer here for a conference . i ordered a gyro . on my own . then he took the next order behind me and fixed their 3 orders first without starting my gyro . i overheard they were regulars . i left .
i went to wendys twice in two days because of the $ 1 drink deal . the first time i went the lady dropped my drink holder and the drinks spilled all over !
they were supposed to open at 12 and they opened almost an hour later ! i had to get to 15 and i was late because of them . should commit to their opening time
here 's an update on my hertz rental last month .
i went into this store for the first time today . i 've lived in wexford for years and have heard many mixed reviews . the store is over crowded and most items are over priced .
must read : just no . i 've never bled so much while getting a pedicure ! she took a personal call while she was massaging '' my legs . soooo overpriced for what i got .
i was very excited for late night chinese , this place closes at 9:30 , we got there at 8:45 and from the moment we got there till the moment we left no fresh food was brought out even with more customers walking in .
terrible customer service . i wanted to change my services , after an hour and a half on the phone , the change i wanted was not done and i was disconnected . called back and was told wait time would be 30 minutes . i gave up .
should have read the yelp reviews before i called this roofing company . i received a text message that tony the estimator would be out at the scheduled time the night before and a text message the day of the appointment . did tony ever show up ? no .
if i could give this place a negative rating , i would . this place does n't deserve stars . it deserves a big middle finger . the employees in this place ignore the customers . kids today are not too bright .
i 've eaten at this place for years . efficient delivery and great prices .
the prices are ok , but i 've been to this store numerous times and i 've never been greeted , not a smile , not a hello , not a thank you , nothing . cashiers always look miserable and today was the final straw for me .
sorry but had to pile on considering this might be the single worst reviewed business in the history of yelp lol and because they are miserable people .
i urge everyone to not go here and waste your valuable time with this pathetic doctor . she does n't care about you or your health issues !
a place you want to be good but it just is n't . the nightmare begins when you sit down and receive the twenty minute introductory lesson on how to put meat into a bowl . then follows the tour of the 8 foot buffet line .
i wish i had my money and 45 minutes back ! i was hoping this place would be better then me doing it myself at the drive through and wiping down the inside myself -- but nope !
worst place ever ! they did n't have no kind of waters not even ice water i had to buy a bottle ! the pupusas were dry , the chicken and the beans were burn . worst mother 's day lunch !
awful . the website promotes open 24 7 . out of nowhere , they continue to close at random times saturday , and sunday nights . what 's even worse , is trying to get gas here on any given day .
the server forgot to place our order and instead of apologizing she blamed it on the cook . no apology given by her . we complained to the manager who said he was not aware of this .
these people are keeping multiple german shepherds outside in over 110 degree heat in crappy nasty small kennels . they should be arrested . who would patronize them ?
coming from someone who works in a chain steakhouse i had high hopes for the steak here . myself and 2 other people all ordered the new york strip . quick service but once the steaks came they were tough and and flavorless .
this place will try and cheat you ! do not support their shady business practices ! the place at first appeared to be a good find . they advertised cheap office visits and quick service .
they are not accomodating to large parties at all . tried to plan a bachelorette party with them and called in advance for advice on when and how to order tickets if we dont know the exact amount yet .
hipster with out of uniform hat and long hair in a pony tail never fails to be rude and condescending . always a disappointment to come to this starbucks and see such an unhappy and unmotivated worker . makes sense as to why there 's never very many people here
i 'd encourage you to get other estimates before using this plumber . was told i needed close to $ 20,000 in repairs . hired an independent camera company to go down through my pipes to tell me exactly what was going on .
booked through priceline name your own price '' . palace station supposedly matched my stated price , only to add $ 16 mandatory fees for stuff i did n't want or need .
very disappointed . we walked in too an empty bar and struggled to get the bar tenders attention . finally waved down another bartender who made eye contact and walked away.
i too had a bad experience with the woman who i think is the owner - i bought a dog toy which my dog was able to rip apart in 2 minutes and actually started choking on .
service was terrible ! we ordered way too much food and the waitress did not care to tell us . the family style '' fajita dinner is basically fajitas for one times 3 ! did n't understand their menu at all .
they advertised 50 off of laser hair removal so i made an appointment . my quote was $ 2600 ! that is absurd . that is not 50 off and even at full price that i 'd way too much .
been to this place twice , first time in the summer of 2004 with some out of town friends . it was all around good . we all enjoyed our meals . and here is the reason for the low rating .
i wish this was a zero . bottom line- false advertising . they doubled the online ad price for a vehicle . i know people have to make a profit . give your business to a company that deserves it .
located in the rio hotel , the menu said homemade corned beef and hash '' . i went with it with eggs up .
could n't eat here . filthy washroom conditions turned us all off . and the greasy smell did n't help . this place needs some major help . do n't waste your time
i really wish i had read these reviews first . i took my laptop in on a saturday as my display went out .
no stars if possible . i walked in with my bf at 9:45 . the place was now packed . all servers acknowledge we came in and says down . however none of them attended to is immediately , which was understandable .
i had a shawarma with a piece of glass in it . after spitting it out and putting on the plate . it was 100 glass , the waitress confirmed and got the owner .
the crepes we ordered came lukewarm . i would expect the freshly made crepe to be warm or hot when it arrives . the coffee served was room temperature as well . kind of odd .
what the hell happened to this place ? how or why would you serve tuna that 's been frozen , defrosted , frozen burnt , defrosted again ? the unagi was good but from my last visit around fall season of 2012 this place has gone downhill terribly .
came in and got a hot drink , drove home not even 10 minutes away and by the time i got home the drink was ice cold and did n't taste how it usually does .
this korean establishment was not the best . the menu was extensive but the food did not live up to the expectations . it either lacked flavor or was just terrible .
horrible i 've been getting shellac manicures for more than a year and a half now from various nail salons . i went to this location for the first time paid 30 $ for a shellac manicure that peeled off withing 3 hrs .
this place is filthy ( i hate to say ) . someone please call the health dept . and do n't let the outside pictures fool you
a miserable experience ! my wife hurt her leg and was unable to walk so we took her to the emergency room . 7 hours later ( 6+ waiting to be seen ) she was misdiagnosed and generally miserable .
i 'm so tired of coming here and eating old meat that is kept warm over the grill in a metal jar with tongs in it . it 's gross and makes my food not worth paying for .
never go to this car dealer . they ran my credit without my permission . they pulled my credit under 2 names . gary hanna and united nissan . very slick . using there old name ( gary hanna ) .
they make it extra inconvenient for you to cancel by asking you to send in a letter stating your cancellation . um , is a phone call and going in not enough for these people to cancel a membership ? who even sends letters anymore ?
this was the worst foot spa i 've ever been to . i wanted foot reflexology and that 's not what they give . i do n't like people digging into my neck muscles doing the same stroke for 10mins . there was no variety in the strokes .
very disappointed , been coming here for a year and the service has been getting slower and slower . that did not bother me till today , walked in with my kids , wife , and father . 6 others walked in after us .
have n't eaten here since they moved their location from main ave in mesa location . no one at the front to greet us when we arrived and when the gentleman seated us , he lacked a personality . should have left at that point .
we had a craving for pizza and decided to pack up the family and head over to one of the last remaining pizza hut restaurants in the area . we were greeted by a friendly staff member and led to a table to sit down .
waste of money . do n't bother coming here . came here at 5 pm and it was completely dead - should have been the first sign to leave . i ordered a regular bubble milk tea ( the original black tea flavor ) and it was extremely diluted .
this supermarket has gone way down hill since last year 's renovations . the shelves are not stocked . the expiration dates are part due or not readable . the fish department people are not knowledgeable and are rude . the deli department are extremely slow .
oh my . terrible business practices . please do not sign there pad before you have looked at everything .
some friends and i stopped in for karaoke . we ordered drinks ( i had the $ 30 margarita ) and had some nachos . omg the nachos were so bad . the drinks were fine .
came here for dinner . poor service and quality of food . we placed our first order ( ayce ) and in half an hour , only 3 out of the 10+ items came , no sushi or sashimi came at all .
my boyfriend and i took his friend here to get his tires installed on the rims . they said to come back in an hour . when we came back they havent started yet .
booked to pick up a car at 7 am and did n't get help until 7:15 am even if i was the only customer there cause they were still setting up for the day .
slowest service and rude patrons . i 'd rather get a gas station coffee over this . baristas do n't know how to make their drinks and they are super slow . bad service .
this place looks to be a great bread shop . very clean and well displayed . very limited selection though . no more than four varieties . i wish i could comment on how tasty it might have been .
a long long time ago in a far away place , i used to go to a place called spaghetti warehouse that was cool , clean , had good service , and had really good food .
the baristas are soooooo slow . i love starbucks , so i 'll be back but geez ! i could understand if they were busy , but they were just talking the whole time .
alex 's falafel is now closed .
very disappointed ! decided to try it for my birthday dinner . went on a thursday night . it was not busy at all but we were there for 3 hours just waiting . for apps , drinks and dinner .
i suggested the place cause i went for dinner the other night and i loved it ! but today everything was just over salty and way too much garlic !
absolutely disgusting . we walked in ready to order our lunch . the cashier was snotty when questions were asked and not very helpful . we ordered and waited , and waited , and waited .
as penske was fixing a tiny chip in my husbands windshield ( which was completely covered by our insurance ) , they cracked our windshield .
if you can wait to see your doctor please do ! the wait is ridiculous , for a hospital they are extremely under staffed .
we stopped in last night for dinner . we did have a 2 for 1 coupon . the 2 dishes we ordered were quite good although it seemed pointless to order the steak salad medium rare as it came well done .
service was terrible ! went there last night 6 6 , and the food was mediocre at best .
rude and disrespectful leasing staff - i was considering moving in here , since my work location is less than a mile from this apartment community .
went through the drive thru and practically had our food thrown at us as the drive thru lady was in such a hurry to rush is off .
while the food and treats are good and the service was good i can not give a fast food joint anything but one star if they charge for sauces , especially ranch .
what 's up with all the belly dancing stores ? are they a front for something else ? do they actually make any money ?
i really hope the owners read and take to heart what so many are saying about this place . the renovation is gorgeous , no doubt about it . it 's cozy and the patio is wonderful .
worst place ever so rude . always out of things and they use gross cheap chocolate on everything . they leave the tub of nutella open and sitting on the counter all day .
worst staff ever ! i had to fight with them over insurance every time i went in . they treated me like i was stupid . the front desk people are super rude ! even the doctors were very rushed and hard to keep up with .
yet again i find myself saying , i will never fly us airways again . '' i think every single time i 've flown with them my flight is delayed or cancelled .
horrible ! ordered a coffee crunch ice cream , received a scoop of ice cream with a tiny bit of caramel an an almond . said something about it and the young girl told me that was the normal '' amount of mix ins .
terrible mexican food . no flavor , dry pork , watery soup , below standard drinks and all at high steak house prices .
horrible . my family had a made a reservation before flying into vegas ; we arrived and had to drive to the fox rental yard to be told that there were n't any cars available , come back tomorrow .
this place has gone way downhill , my wife and i used to love having dinner here . painfully slow service from start to finish . waitress was nice enough but that 's where the positive experience ended . drinks took forever and entrees took about 40 minutes .
visited here a number of times on recent stay and always unclean . had a bad experience with the staff who would not honour their cash register generated discount coupons and were very rude . changed to the starbucks on lobby floor who happily honoured coupons and were friendly .
got a flat tire in their parking lot because they failed to replace or place a tree in an island designed to have a tree in it , this is going to cost me about 150 bucks thanks liquor world dunkin ' donuts roberto 's in checkers .
i went to have the belt of my booths repaired . the guy told me he 'll do it in 2 days . went back in two days and not done . he said he 's gon na call me . a week after , no calls .
this place is terrible . worst customer service and over priced ! i ordered food and it took over and hour and a half to arrive . when it did it was cold , and soggy .
my old irrigation system was leaking so guru fixed it for $ 600.00 . i later called for an estimate for additional work , but never received one . another company got the money for that .
do not got this place . i 'm so mad i did not want to tip the man . the nail tech who did my pedicure had a horrible attitude and almost refused to do what i asked !
i do n't understand how so many people work here without actually doing any work . the line is often wrapped around the building and no one seems to have any interest in doing their job . do n't waste your time coming here .
after standing in line forever while the cashier talked his head off to a couple talking how everyone knew him as the costco guy , he then checked out another lady and as she left he said thank you betty . then it was my turn .
called to inquire about a half sheet cake . woman said i 'm sorry ! no speak english '' and hung up . guess i 'll go somewhere where they speak this country 's language .
ordered the calamari and a buffalo chicken pizza with no onions and paid an extra fee for a side of ranch . the calamari was so over cooked that i could n't chew through it and the pizza had a lot of onions . and they forgot our ranch .
staff in this place are very rude and make you feel rushed ! the food is not that great and they give you waay to much food on your plate .
very long turnaround time for repairs , poor communication , broke things on vehicle from not using proper care and did not accept ownership . other parties insurance paid for repairs and even if it were free again i would not bring a car back here . horrible experience .
i am staying at a hotel and ordered pizza and wings and was very inconvenienced and disappointed that there was no thought to provide napkins and plates . for that very reason , i would not order from this restaurant again .
went this morning for the first time for a meeting with one other person . wanted to sit at one of the high top tables to have some privacy and be able to speak without people close by . was advised there 's no service at these tables .
went to this place to get a quote on work after waiting 5 hours i was quoted 3 times the going rate . i told them i did n't want the work done and was charged $ 155 to put the tires back on vehicle .
seriously this place is awful ! super long lines with only one person working . that one employee has no sense of urgency and looks like he hates life .
i love mai . she does a great job but if you go for a pedicure and fill trust that you wo n't get them done in one visit .
arrived on friday night with party of 15 ( willing to split up 3 families or accommodate the staff ) and the manager gave us a hard time . plenty of tables available . worried about sitting kids together and a sever getting stuck with no tip .
the owner was rude to his employees right in front of the customers very unprofessional in my opinion . i would not recommend going here and would give in 0 stars if it was an option . other than the owner being rude the staff were very friendly .
the worst store ever , racist and wo n't help even if it is western union policy please please please do n't ever go here
service is so slow i will purposely drive to other locations . i know they track the time to complete orders for customers and the fact that it has n't improved tells me someone locally does n't care .
the service was terrible and there was n't really anything special about the food . we came as a group of 7 and they brought out dishes to the table that we did not even order .
so we love chuck e cheese . have had many birthday parties over the last 10 years . our usual location on alma school in mesa has really declined , and we recently moved closer to this one . service is bad .
i will never go in this shop again . i was looking for a few pieces and i wandered in with my daughter . they snubbed my size 6 daughter even though she was clearly with me .
it has been two times where the employees at this location have been rude to me .
worst customer service at 7pm on 1 6 17 i had some questions about a product which an employee could n't answer so i was told to come in when a manager was working to speak with them .
this place is gross . i waited in the drive thru for 10 minutes . i 'm guessing that was why my food was burnt .
i paid $ 37.50 for a pedicure that looks like i did it myself . i took a good look at my feet once i got home and my nails are uneven and the paint job is horrible .
me and my wife visited this spot at 3am yesterday and it was just not as run well as any other ihop in the valley .
we got the best news of all today , bobbi black is no longer with the company .
why do n't you publish your new hours , however temporary they may be , so that people do n't waste time traveling to you only to find that you are closed ?
we had a 35 unit building in phoenix and we were down to 2 different companies based on our interview process , of whom to hire as a property manager .
this place is not worth the money . they even asked for a $ 20 tip . which was told to them that they do not get to negotiate tip price . .or even if they get one at all .
do not purchase this living social deal ! i tried for six months to schedule the pedicure living social deal and have always been told they are too booked .
went in today 3 28 around 1:30pm to buy a few things as they have up to 75 off clearance winter clothing which is great but the customer service not as much .
absolutely the worst value for your money . the menu does not reflect what you are actually getting .
avoid the burger , chicken looked ok. burger like a frozen pre-made patty . not hot and bacon looks like food poisoning in a pink dress . one star for the fries being ok .
this has got to be the worse chinese i 've ever had ! food is cold and not good at all ! and the service is bad !
i was just cut off by one of there trucks . i will be making a police report . basically sandwiched me over so he could get in . i beep my horn and he flipped me the bird .
scheduled to do tacos for an event and did n't show up until after the event was over . put everyone in a bind . horrible customer service .
went here tonight , and i can safely say that this is the worst strip club i or anyone in my group have ever been to . some things you can go cheap , sadly strippers is not one of those things .
i will continue to write this review , as it seems to disappear and the positive reviews stay . do not go to this salon . please read . i came in for a simple trim and walked out -10 '' . yes , 10 inches !
these people are completely incompetent . a month ago i had my oil changed with them and asked them to look at my tires as i have a long daily commute .
really wish i could leave negative stars ! uneducated staff . management included . 5 tables and server could n't get any thing right . including handling his apparent mistakes . own up ! serving ai n't easy . leave it to people who can multitask !
do n't eat this dirty food with terrible customer service . i have eaten here twice and both times it was way over priced , overlooked and terribly dry and the service was despicable . adriana was demeaning and curt .
truly one of the worst places to eat at in vegas . i ate here a while back and it 's just plain horrid . even old white people wo n't eat here .
it 's a pity that i have to give this 1 star . it 's basically a human gas station serving unappealing , unappetizing and bland food . the decor is the same . the hygiene is dubious at best .
my noodles came out luke warm , husband came out nice and hot . as we sit here and wait for our food the tables we not cleaned , the signage on the table nasty dirty and soda area a mess not properly stocked .
this is probably the worst mcdonalds ever . two weeks in a row i was charged for an item that was never put in the bag . in the first instance the barbecue sauce was in the bag but the mcnuggets were not there .
i came here yesterday , i will never make the mistake of going back . two of the donuts we got were under cooked and had to be thrown out . the donut i had tasted fine , but hours later i was sick to my stomach .
this place is disgusting , just killed about 10 little roaches in the kitchen . hair and bugs in the bathroom , a used bandaid under the seat cushion . stay away , far away ! yuck !
i 've gone in three times and they 've gotten my order wrong each time . medium earl grey two creams half sugar , the girl gave me lemon tea with two creams and a milk ham and cheese sandwich .
i once loved to shop here but not any more , rude and dirty stores .
i have been eating at various monicals pizza for most of my life and they alway promise and deliver two things : their product is mediocre and it is over priced .
i had a very bad experience trying to enjoy our food but can not cuz their services suck . it 's a very loud buffet and over price
i needed three appliances repaired so i thought i could save some money if i got them done by one company . so i made an appointment for the next day from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm .
this company continues to break the rules and leave flyers and brochures underneath our front door . they are trespassing on private property and violating the no soliciting rule .
the worst mc donalds ever ! waited 30 mins in drive thru and got cold hard frys and cold meat and super nasty dark chicken on mc spicy ! the employees are just trash ! do n't go stay away ! worst money spent at fast food restaurant
i have been a customer for 5 years . every year their promotion that makes it affordable , expires . they then stick it to you on your bill , usually $ 10 , until you enter into a new promotion contract .
this location is awful . my husbands breakfast sandwich was cold . i was given the wrong bagel and it was stale . i specifically asked for no shmear and it was loaded with it . do not recommend this location .
i have taken my vehicle here for several months . the quality has gone down hill to the point that i wo n't be going back .
sushi was fishy . food was generally awful . complained to server who did nothing about it . just said the chef was looking into the problem . we were the only customers in the place and the service was still terrible !
paid for some repair work here . after the problem continued i took it to another mechanic . i was informed that the spark plugs and air filter for the ac i paid to be replaced were never done .
i went to the 1 year anniversary today . they advertised $ 8 for a glass and 2 beers . when i got there they had switched to $ 10 for a glass and two half pours . to make it worse , the glass was a wine glass !
called and asked to speak to a manager to which i was told they were n't in . before i had a chance to ask if i could leave my information they hung up . great people skills . :
had a chicken shawarma wrap there . not great at all . the pita was n't fresh as well . there are much better shawarma places , not in the area though ( mr. laffa , sofra grill , dr. laffa all much better ) .
i was very disappointed with lucy 's . i had made an appointment for wedding cake tasting . when i went in for my appointment they had no idea about it ! the person in charge had an emergency and left the store .
this is the last time i 'll be ordering from this particular location . the first couple times i ordered from there , the food tasted great .
expensive , mediocre , slow . i suspect those two 5 star reviews by users with 0 friends and 3 reviews are probably fakes .
the location and decor are wonderful . we enjoyed a great view of the lawn of the civic center . the food was even good though a little pricey .
customer service is bad , specially at late hours ! maybe because they are open late and they are tired by then . others , the young ones were playing with pizza dough and throwing it at each other and hitting the monitors with it .
boy oh boy bullshit and from a member of the church . i did n't say the date so how can you have listened unless you are the one that does not provide customer service . this company does not provide eager buyers customer service on the phone .
poor customer service walked in there has to get my daughters hair cut right away they said it be 45 minutes . no one was in there . i understand appointments but learn customer service and try saying hello .
so for 31 dollars my car was half assed . i had to have them vacuum it a 2nd time , there was water spots all over it , and there was none of the scent that was supposed to be put in it .
poor trainers and bad management . i ended up at the er after the 2nd session . the 1st session they charged us and just sat with us to talk about nutrition . seriously it gets better .
terrible experience over the weekend when my family went for lunch . we were seated by the hostess . after waiting 15-20 min for a server to come give us menus wait on us , i had to go to the hostess and request them .
been to this place 4 times now . ask the gas clerk if they went out of business she said no someone back there . yelled back called number still nothing . guess they do n't need business .
ok , despite good intentions clear air cab left us stranded again this saturday afternoon . so we are giving up . setting up a regular pickup is not a guarantee that you will indeed have a ride . back to square one .
service was terrible here . when we got here , we went and placed our food as usual . but then once we got our food , a few minutes later as we were eating the waitress asked us if we needed some to-go boxes .
just had the worst the experience at this restaurant . my fiancé and i have been coming here for years and we 've never been treated the way this hostess has ever treated us today .
was taken in by the 20 discount , and all i have to say is , i would not go there again even if it was 50 off . the staff looked miserable and unfriendly . we had to ask twice for our water .
honestly one of the worst experiences getting my nails done ! went in on saturday and my friend and i were taken right away which was a good thing being all the other nail salons were so busy . well i should have waited because my nails are horrible !
horrible food . who has a mexican food restaurant and does n't serve carne asada . they only have ground beef and chicken ! plus they do not accept debit cards .
the worst towing company that i have ever come in contact with . not business like . look like a group of hoodlums to take your money . my son and friends had just got out of the car and they booted the car .
the worst place ! super cuts and great clips have cheap prices i agree but you get what you pay for . my kids usual barber shop was closed and being that i already had issues with great clips i decided to try super cuts .
do not give them your money unless you are sure you are going to enroll your child .
what a disgraceful business this woman operates . i have never had such a horrible billing experience . her office staff do not call back to inquiries . someone is always out . i have had to have united healthcare fraud division get them to pay attention .
07 28 16 moved from michigan to texas . terrible experience . damaged goods , furniture held hostage for twice as long as promised . run do n't walk away from this company .
it is 105 degrees outside so we figured we 'd sit inside to enjoy an afternoon snack . unfortunately , it must be 95 degrees inside ! have n't these people heard of air conditioning ? this is just being cheap !
my review is in response to an interaction i had today with the owner . i provided some feedback , which was meant to be helpful . i point out an error and my feedback was polite and meant to be helpful .
royal flush capitol of the world my ass . the machines are tight . the clientele is scary . i was constantly looking over my shoulder . i felt so uncomfortable here that a future visit is highly unlikely .
complete bullshit store . over priced wax and flowers . quality is about the same compared to the many places i have been . not to mention they got my order wrong and my wax was short .2 of a gram my first visit .
toilet overflowed no one helped to clean up water everywhere smh ! i had a no smoking room but it smelled like smoke
$ 1000 deposit was not refunded without a lengthy fight . had to go through our credit card company and the bbb .
really , cleaning and changing the taps at noon , aka lunch time '' on a friday ? downright stupid ! been 10 minutes waiting for a simple beer and the taps are still not assembled . anticipating they 'll taste like soap : - (
hot and spicey and the owner there gives a lot of bs . keep a lot of water when you pick anything from here .
guess i should of read reviews first ! i purchased a living social deal , called to set up an appointment many times , no return call no answer ever ! left messages numerous times , still a no go !
if you want to come in and relax while having your nails done sandra and allie are great . however prepare to sweat because it 's as hot as it is outside ! owner to cheap to pay for the a c or what ?
where are all the employees , almost 10 am sunday morning , car wash area packed , and 3 people cleaning cars . been here almost 45 minutes now . i spend $ 80.00 a week at this place for 2 cars .
i hate this store with a passion . anytime they hire a decent employee the idiot staff drives them out . i have gotten terrible service seo employees repeatedly over the years and it 's the same losers still doing it again and again .
this airport is hell . dirty , hot and smelly . men 's bathroom had multiple broken toilets with trash overflowing . their charging stations are a joke . either broken or 50 people to an outlet . pray that you only have the slightest layover .
i ca n't even give them one star ! worst customer service ever ! i wo n't mention names but the manager and assistant manager are terrible . i 've been to other men 's warehouse stores and this one is by far the worst !
what used to be a great place just is n't anymore . do n't waste your time like i did . our party of 3 waited 20 minutes before being offered water .
first off we waited at front door ten minutes last sunday while the host was talking with bartenders and servers by the back bar . when he finally came up he did n't apologize just said what can i help you with ? umm i guess a table .
i called and asked if he was available to help me move , and he rudely told me that i had already called and that he had already told me no ? um , i had never called him in my life .
well . i telephoned lisa no less than five times in the past week and left messages each time about scheduling an appointment . i never received a return call .
there where roaches and flies in the dinning area , as well as the restroom . the staff was polite but i could n't eat the food because i was too grossed out .
took a client here because i 've always found the one downtown not amazing but always good but was very disappointed here . food was blech - just not good . i could tell others felt the same . and the service ? oh sorry forgot about your wine .
the only reason i go here is for their marinaded skirt steak . they do have a wide assortment of mexican ingredients and products , but the staff here is so rude .
so i want to thank you fahrenheit . because of you and your poor customer service , and your inability to accommodate a reservation made more than 7 days ago , for party of 7 , we were able to enjoy an amazing dinner at aria .
be aware ! never ever rent a car from this location ! their employees are thieves ! i have never been so sure of myself that i accidentally left my shoes under the car seat , called their lost and found but said they were closed on weekends .
i do not recommend . i had to take my car in 3x to get the front passenger side door to not jam . then 3x to get the same window fixed ( it would n't go down ) .
just waited over an hour . no car , no explanation or why . i canceled the reservation via the national customer service line explaining what was happening . not even an apology !
very bad customer service ! no attention given to the incoming customers . stood there for 30 mins and no one greeted . shame !
i 've been coming here for almost 10 years and i 'm done . it 's gone down steadily the last few years . bad service and not as nice as they used to be . i 'll drive the extra 1 4 mile and go to ryan 's
seth the owner had been unprofessional on two occasions . i would never use this company but i was forced to use company because of my american home shield program .
terrible property managers . was without hot water for 5 days , no one seemed to care and did not communicate updates . staff especially ( sharon ) rude and not helpful .
rude staff went in with my girlfriend and was immediately carded . i did n't have my id but we are 26 years old ! the staff did not need to be so rude . went to adult superstore down the street instead .
here is my response to a very rude email i received after this yelp review . be your own judge . alan wrote : thank you kristine . you do n't tell me the truth about how many windows you have and then you lie on yelp .
i spent about five minutes on the phone only to jump on yelp and start reading these reviews . i wanted to make sure it would be worth it before committing 90 minutes of my life .
yikes , love the local place . but tonight was horrible . slow service , wrong food delivered , drinks delivered 20 minutes after being ordered , second sushi dish delivered 30 minutes after being ordered . asked for check 10 minutes ago and still waiting .
i would never send my friends '' to andy 's . i had used tanya and left for another salon because she was never ready at my appointment time .
warning rip off ! my wife and i decided to ride hoping for a good time , what a joke this ride is if you can even call it a ride .
every time i order the iced caramel latte i get a different variation . today 's was the worst . no caramel drizzle and it was still warm .
i usually love this store . i 've been going for years . i sent one of friends in to purchase hair and she was taken advantage of . she was told that she was being hooked up . ''
if you come here after the other clubs have shut down , you might as well skip it . it 's $ 20 girl $ 30 guy . the bouncers have major attitude .
my boyfriend and i are avid starbucks customers.
i arrived to dominos to order a pizza ; however , they said they were only doing delivery . so , i left and called them from the parking lot and attempted to place an order for delivery . they claimed they could not deliver to the parking lot .
definitely would not recommend this service for locating apartments . if they realize they wo n't make any money off you , they 'll drop you like a bad habit . no returned calls .
not at all impressed . mike was at our house on monday to fix our gas oven . he left after 2 minutes and said he knew exactly what the problem was and he would call me back .
summerlicious ( most reviews mention that or winterlicious ) visit included awful service and perhaps even worse food . easily our worst meal in toronto .
if you look at the same reviews below me they too experienced what i have . either 1 undercooked food , or 2 food poisoning . in my case it was definitely food poisoning .
i had my transmission replaced here and 2 months later it went out again because they installed it improperly . they tried to then make me pay for labor to replace it !
avoid this place in the morning , very long wait , it does n't matter if you go inside or use the drive thru . they also messed up our order at the drive thru and forgot a doughnut .
i love playing bingo in las vegas . however this bingo is not as great as others . i asked the cocktail waitress at the 1am session a question . she seemed annoyed and rolled her eyes at me . her name is jennifer of jessica .
it was not worth $ 77 . for 2 people . spice market at planet hollywood was a lot better for $ 20 less for 2 people . i will not be back .
such a crappy store in general . do n't buy work out capri pants from them . i bought some and you can literally see my underwear because they are so see through . it was such a waste of my money and they over price them .
my children and i visited two days ago . we have n't had such horrible food . the food tasted spoiled the graveyard on the biscuits tasted weeks old and omg the biscuits were as hard as a rock .
we received a flyer on our door so we decided to give delivery a try . when we called they answered then hung up on us . so we called back to place our order .
stay far , far away from this place . my child was constantly sick while attending this daycare and was injured several times due to lack of supervision ( including several bites ) .
i am typically a forgiving reviewer . by in this case i ca n't hold back . this was my younger son 's favorite resaurant and we often celebrated his birthday and other events here . we always enjoyed the above average food and ambience here .
service is very poor . and the food is not fresh at all . would not recommend coming here . horrible customer service . i would not even rate it one star . might as well go to the grocery store and make my own food .
wtf do people see in this place ? this is the 3rd time i 've been subjected to this miserable dump of a city and somehow it manages to get worse each time .
so dillards does not let girls try on dresses if they do n't look like they are going to buy . which mommy and daddy might buy them . what jerks . has no one ever seen pretty woman ? big big mistake .
horribly disappointing ! i love healthy juice smoothie places and this one is on my way to work . i got an offer on facebook for a half off deal and went this evening to try it out .
came at 7:30 the lady working there was barely walking to the door stating their not open yet '' when according to yelp they should have been open at 7 . if i could leave no stars i would .
stopped by for my t-mobile tuesday deal . i have learned to not come back to this location .
geek squad guy from this store came out and spoke to my 40 year old housekeeper , then decided he did n't want to install , so he told his boss no one was home .
i just came here and found a feather in my chicken and the ladies at the counter were in the back on their phones and eating in the kitchen when i tried to get their attention .
this bank is very inconvenient . there online banking is awkward , it took me two trips to the branch and two phone calls to set it up . now i have been trying to access their bill pay online and the site has been unavailable for three day .
my office orders lunch from this restaurant fairly frequently . .and not once has our food been delivered without a problem . we have had sweet and sour chicken delivered with no sweet and sour sauce , entire meals forgotten , the wrong sides , etc .
we checked out their website , thought they had some good looking food at reasonable prices . we drove there today at 6 pm ( website said open until 9pm ) . they are closed . chairs up on the tables .
this is the first time i have ever came to this restaurant and i am very unhappy already . i did n't even eat here yet .
if i could give these people less than 1 star i would . i ordered two bands from them with a six day shipping turnaround . these were simple bands with no customization other than engraving . i paid by credit card at the time of order .
absolutely the most incompetent health care provider i have ever had the displeasure of dealing with . the office staff are completely disorganized . i called them to make sure they accepted my insurance . they said they did , so i set an appointment .
i came in no one spoke & i felt like we were wasting their time . i would never tell anyone i know to come to this location
love this swiss chalet - besides the always great chicken , fried and awesome sauce - this one comes with an outdoor patio - which is great for sunny summer days .
i got a tattoo from the owner . he rushed and gave me what my new artist referred to as the worst case of scar tissue he has ever seen . very nice man but i had to pay 300 $ to get my tattoo fixed .
first time customer . wo n't be a repeat that 's for sure . way too much to write , but i will say terrible service and incredibly overpriced . payed $ 37 for 3 sandwiches . what the heck ? easy on the mayo , guys . sheesh .
flo 's asian '' kitchen . where is the asian food ? the food had no flavor whatsoever ! it makes the ultra gross chain restaurant pf changs seem like asian food in my opinion . not to mention this asian '' restaurant is extremely overpriced !
the worst of the worst flights i 've taken in my entire life . the flight attendants are nasty and the seats are very uncomfortable .
i 've been going to congee star for a few years now . either to dine in or take out . the food is good , the price is not the best i 've seen . but the service is poor .
i would give a no star if i could . worst experience ever . they messed up our food and made absolutely no apologies for it i would never go back .
the blood mary was ok , but the bar tender did n't get the memo about the friendliest airport '' ! sorry we gave you any biz !
worst chinese ever . wontons in the wonton soup were mushy .
this has to do with the delivery trucks they contract central valley auto transports drivers suck ! one almost hit a school bus on the highway this morning and cut me off in the process with my daughter in the car .
avoid - they do n't respond to mail asking about problems . and repeat complaints get zero action , very poor . but for money they 're quick to ask . i would give them zero stars .
beware ! place has become pretentious . cover for women now and expensive drinks .
front office staff is extremely rude . very unprofessional and makes you feel like you are bothering them by just walking into the place . i 'm sorry but i do n't feel like i have to drop a few hundred dollars and feeling like a bother .
beware of concert times went to the ghost bar at the palms last night for a peaches show that was advertised to start at 10pm . at 11:45pm i asked one of the employees what time peaches was going to go on . he said 1:00am or 1:30am .
even though i have a high deductible health plan , where i am told specifically not to pay upfront for a doctor service , this office disregards this and asks to pay $ 80 for a general appointment before seeing the doctor .
the atmosphere is extremely nice . however the service was terrible . had to hunt my server down and eventually asked for the manager . i enjoy the old spaghetti factory nationwide , just not this one . the one in phoenix is way better ! with better service !
horrible experience getting a pedicure here . they bumped into my toe twice and had to redo both toes and pinky and offered no compensation . will never come back here again !
i 've had reservations to travel lodge since february for the cleveland marathon . upon arrival to check in , we were told that the air conditioner was not working and that they were trying to fix it . the lobby was disgusting and totally dirty .
this pub , that claims to be the oldest in edinburgh , was a disappointment . the food was average and no different from any other pub in the area . our group consisted of two couples , one of which was a well known political figure .
they refuse to give prices over the phone . it takes a desperate company to use this tactic to try and get you in the store .
came here with my daughter , ordered a sno cone . the sno cone was not shaved ice , more like crushed ice bits you get out of a fridge . it hurt her teeth and she could not eat it , and my kid loves sno cones .
the manager here is completely incompetent . he found every excuse possible not to print 2 color copies that i needed .
i do not feel alan is fit for his job . he is rude , from the moment i got in the car i could tell it was not going to be a smooth ride .
waited 15 minutes for someone to take our order for a beer and a glass of wine . not rocket science . waited another 15 and gave up . walked out right behind another couple equally frustrated by not just poor service but complete lack of service .
from sales to service , this place is the worst . the pushy salesperson tried to bully me into writing an online review before i even had my car .
i recently had a couple of issues with this company .
this was the most ridiculous & waste of money ! i bought a groupon to get $ 100 worth of removal . which i guess it 's $ 100 off . i needed 2 tvs removed from my living room .
what a rip off ! tried to con me into paying over $ 1600 for a new water heater plus the $ 89 yearly service agreement . called another company and had a brand new quality unit installed for under $ 900 the same day .
avoid this place ! first off the lady kept asking about tip during the massage , 20 tip for hour massage '' . second i asked for a deep tissue and i got a back rub . i ended up stopping at 30 minutes .
please do not go here . they gave me the runaround for weeks to repair a broken ipod .
stay away from this place terrible . i could not believe there was poop in the elevators there and i stepped into it . i was staying on 7 6 and 7 7 and it was a nightmare . the reception desk is awful and very rude .
they used to take tips on your card and the last time i went there they said they only take cash for the tips now because of taxes .
the lady with long , braided hair did n't welcome us in . we already had a bad vibe . service : it sucks , they did n't come as often . only came to the table to deliver our food and asked for drinks .
a business that 's using groupon , is trying to acquire new customers , right ?
terrible service by the guy behind the counter way over priced it 's cheaper to buy new and talks bad about customers when they are leaving would n't go back to that place again .
i was really disappointed with the waitress . i seriously did not need to know it was her first day back from having the flu , and i really did not enjoy being soaked when the server dropped a tray of waters on our table and all over me .
the absolute slowest starbucks drive-thru i 've ever been through . been through it 3 times with only 3 cars in it each time and it 's take 15-20 minutes to get through it . with only 3 cars in line !
i give this place 1 star . my nails look terrible i got a french tip with a 3d design . they have a bunch of bubbles and are not smooth .
horrible ! worst fedex kinkos i 've ever been to ! they need to get new computers or clean up the ones they have . it takes forever just to load up a browser and do n't even think about doing multiple functions on it .
celebrating my sons birthday was fun . however the service was so slow . and at the end of the night they double charged for the pool tables .
if i could leave 0 stars i would ! my $ 30 gel polish lasted all of 2 days before chipping ! i finally returned to get the nails redone and they refused to repair the nail with the nail design without charging me extra !
purchased a group on here . i called this establishment 4 times on 4 different days in which i left messages . did not get contacted until 2 weeks later only to be told that my wife and i could not have a lesson together .
hours are posted until 7pm . show up at 6:45 pm place is locked up and nobody inside . extremely disappointing .
first and last time . poor service , bad tasting food with very low quality . we do n't expect much from cheap buffet , but food should be at least safe to eat and has a taste . will never come back .
please do yourself a favor and do not go here , especially if you have kids . the food is so-so at best and our server was not nice , not helpful and generally bad at her job .
we came in here for a good late night meal . but they were so slow getting us seated and serving food . we waited a total of 1.5 hours to get seated and another 1.5 to get our food .
for the msg lover . the instant the $ 5 ramen was placed in front of me , the overwhelming scent of msg soup washed over me .
the first time i used galloping groomer to have a lion cut done on my persian cat i had a good experience . unfortunately i can not say the same for my second attempt .
i wrote a review few months ago and it was not a very nice one . it got posted and yelp removed it ! i got horrible service from hug n pups .
get ready . rats ! yep ! the size of cats ! i saw a dude taking a dead i 've to the garbage ! no lie . one time a couple months ago i saw someone in the stock room ? smoking while in the building . nasty .
this place has the worst staff i have ever had to deal with in my life ! i myself work in a medical office and have had to go the extra mile for a patient lots of time .
i got my nails filled here and they look horrible . the lady that did them was in a rush for her next appointment that was made while i was in the middle of getting mine done .
this place is probably alright if you 're there for a few drinks on a weeknight with some friends , but do n't come here for the food or service .
i came here with my sister to get a portrait done . the tattoo artist johnny said we had to pay half up front and half when it was finished . we gave him $ 400 down . he then kept rescheduling appointments .
worst customer service . my boyfriend and i got two burritos , they put on the wrong sauces and had a bad attitude towards fixing it .
even by airport standards this place is a huge rip off . i paid $ 6.25 for some hummus and what did i get ? two small 1 ounce containers and 2 pieces of ciabatta cut into 4s .
took an hour and 20 minutes to get a cold disgusting pizza . they used to be so good .
warning ! do not go to this dental office . the staff and the dentist do no communicate well with each other and the price is ridiculously outrageous , the front desk staff do no know what they are doing .
poor customer service , lackluster follow through and aweful installation . got glass all inside my car and acted like they have never heard of this happening also did not properly mount my rearview mirror .
friendly and attentive service , but beware the food . just finished lunch there an hour ago and i 'm already dead sick . two hours left until the work day is over but i do n't know if i 'll make it .
my daughter and i were in this store looking at jewelry . we were helped by the owner . at first , he was very helpful . we were looking for particular sizes . obviously we had to try on many because the rings were n't sized .
was stuck there for seven hours ( even though there were only four rooms in use ) they only ran two test and told me they did n't know why i was in sooo much abdominal pain told me to go to my family dr .
horrible place . they ca n't decide if they want to be a bar or a club . food is below par and the service is slow .
omg this time was horrible ! service sucked and the food was even worse ! we came here because my mother really wanted to try their specialty dish . the meats in our soup were spoiled and they forgot my order .
wish i could give this place no stars . waiting in line to pay for 15 minutes . one customer holding up the line but they have not opened up another cash . the manager came by and acknowledge the wait and walked away .
stay away ! this is a terrible company to buy from ! do not work them as tempted as you may be . i have customers coming back to me telling me how terrible curtis is to work with . make a long story short , go else where .
my daughter has been a patient here for years and i have always been happy . i decided to get a cleaning myself .
worst experience ever . i purchase coupon on groupon for 1 year unlimited service . first appointment was booked quickly . after this good luck : i try to rebooked my second appointment and been told , that next available one is in a month .
disgrace of a place . barber said he understood cut i wanted for my child and he decided to cut off all of it . my son was crying at the end . and another barber didnt want to cut my sons hair cause it was long .
are you looking for a groomer to injure your dog and pretend like nothing happened ? then have i got the place for you ! the first two times we brought penny here , the experience was unremarkable .
i ate here only once . they served me cold miso soup and rice that was crusty . the sushi was horrible . the fish was not fresh . the service sucked . i had to ask for a check .
the food always takes extremely long . the customer service is sub par . the lobby is always dirty . the parking lot is hard to navigate .
gucci store at the scottsdale fashion square .
sat for 15 min and no one came over so i left . slowest moving staff ive ever seen . atleast 4 different servers walked or more like strolled by like 10x each
an diesem tag war der laden leer . die kellner waren sehr lustig und die pizza brauchte eine stunde bis sie fertig war .
car wash always out of order at night , the once or twice a year that it does work it slams into ur car so hard it snaps ur mirrors ! stay away from this shithole
when i first moved to las vegas , farmer boys served real beef and the hamburgers were fat and juicy . now , you get this flat nasty burger that tastes like cloth . i do n't eat there anymore . there vegtables are better than there burgers now .
would not use them again , service did not kill or deter bugs and the owner tech got rude with our family and accused us that it was our fault . hired a new company who treated immediately and havent had a problem again .
i 've become a regular customer here over the last few months and have loved the convenience of the location and have had generally good threading and manicures . i was excited to have my nails done today . but ended up having a very unsettling experience instead .
do n't bother making an appointment cause your going to wait 2+ hours to get seen even if it 's a simple annual check up .
looking back at the good reviews , my only conclusion is that most of the reviewers dont seem to be indian .
i 've been calling for a couple hours now . multiple times per hour , sometimes back to back for 10 mins straight and no one has picked up the phone .
not a business oriented hotel . they do n't get it . i 'm certain its ok room wise , but do n't try and hold a meeting there . they are out of touch with business needs .
i 've been on hold for 2.5 hours , you guys need more people to help at your call center . i am annoyed ! by the time i get someone to help me my damn phone battery will be dead .
i go to spicy pickle alot considering it 's right next door to my job . lately , the service is getting slower , portions smaller , and price higher . today i got a club pannini , and broccoli cheddar soup .
updating my review after making several more visits . this taco bell sucks . they have things on the menu that they are n't even selling yet ( and the employee 's have n't even heard of the item ) .
terrible service . food was disappointing . they tried to charge my father for someone else 's order because they assumed '' they were together . how unorganized can you get ? they tried to charge him for two meals and he did n't even receive his food !
terrible service soup & salad took 35 minutes steer clear my friend left instead of waiting 35 minutes for his soup and salad . my burger was also shot . only ate here because i literally had to and now i 'll never make the same mistake again
umm so we got light sauce or i mean no sauce on our specialty buffalo ranch chicken . there was no sauce . .no tomato or ranch just a couple chicken nuggets on a large pizza .
based on the better than average reviews for chinese buffets in the area , we decided to give this place a try . clearly it is a dive which we do not mind at all as long as the food is good . the food was awful .
they ran out of bread pockets for breakfast , then ran out of coffee ( but kept selling the cups ) . the staff was indifferent and not helpful .
this is first time i try to use their service . base on the review , i think they should be good . we call for service for my water heater . they are way overcharged . i frankly told them that i have to compare the service .
they will do anything to sell you a car , including lying to you about what is included in your service packages ! buyer beware
should have read the other reviews before dropping in . service is terrible with food and drink hardly worth the wait .
now it has been just about 60 days , i called again with the manager promising to get back to me within 48 hours and guess what ? no call . i am thoroughly disgusted with their attitude towards customers .
poor service . i tried to reschedule service with this company and had no luck with adequate follow up . i would n't recommend this organization for your shades .
i tried echo & rig 3 times . i will never go back . lunch food is so so and dinner is better at other summerlin restaurants . steaks are sometimes 4 star but skip the dry crab cakes .
worst place to go to ! no one attends you when you enter . had to ask if we could seat ourselves and had to pickup menus on the way . 10 minute wait for the server to attend you .
giving one star is too much when they really should be getting 0 stars . my coworker and i were just there , and we were waiting in the drive-thru for 25min . making us late for work .
ghetto hotel ! cheap , dirty , and the food suck ( buffet ) . it remind me of east la .
staff is friendly , however food is not good , i ordered tawook but what i got was n't even a grilled chicken . was n't able to match what i ordered to what i eat . also , the chicken pieces was not fresh .
out of business and i bought tons of coupons for future deluxe washes ! bummer ! their phone is disconnected also .
terrible cashier 's on a friday afternoon . one in a st patrick 's outfit is shooting the breeze with a store manager that 's getting off shift and buying personal items . a line backing up and both are clueless .
rip off- put on a waiting list wed. called them friday and one had opened up but the quoted price by the manager bobbi went up $ 40 . rented around the corner for $ 100 dollars less a month . shame on you for ripping off college students !
for a place that is suppose to specialize in noodle , they sure do suck . i tried two different noodles . they both lacked any kind of flavor . the soup tasted like warm water with meat and vegetables mixed inside . the service ? what service ?
management needs to give these people some help . one waitress for half the room and one bartender for a full bar . poor guy was sweating and losing customers because he could n't handle it all .
i hesitate in writing this because the scone recipe they used the day i visited must have surely been a mistake . the second i picked it up i knew something was wrong . usually crusty and crumbly , this scone was spongy .
last time we came , chris and april did me and my moms nails and they were great ! they no longer have april or chris and they were the best .
this is the worst bank in phoenix . i changed both my personal and business accounts from chase due to there lack of tellers .
very long waiting times , not enough seats to accommodate all patients in the waiting room . the rest of the staff have been fine , but the doctor was very unprofessional about a glasses re-check .
zero star if i could ! for the cancellation you have to drop in the office by person or mail ! ( the mailing address is usa ) . for what sake the email is used for ?
do not eat at the jerk spot .
you can expect decent service only until the sale is made . when it comes to delivery , they suck ! they said the range we wanted was not in stock and assured it will be delivered within 10 days to two weeks .
my mother was looking forward to celebrating her birthday and having fancy transportation . so she was thrilled when deal chicken offered round trip transport and made a reso 2 months in advance .
i ordered a beef brisket soup and there was no meat in the soup . complete waste of money .
seven of us went to an early dinner . we like to visit local places . none of us will be returning . the service was good . the food was ok . the rules were not . no substitution without a charge .
on 2 17 13 , i took my family here to eat . this would have been my first visit here . upon our arrival , i knew there was going to be a long wait because it was sunday afternoon .
well i was in need of a clean up hair cut . we ran into sports clips . cute girls but they are beginners when it comes to hair cuts . i wish they just said they would be practicing on my head .
i 've been to several popeyes , this is the first one i 've visited that does n't carry the butterfly shrimp , which is their best menu item . what does that say about this location if they do n't support the menu .
this subway provided me the worst service i have ever received from a fast food restaurant . first we waited in the drive thru like for literally 20 minutes before even been helped .
what is up with the pigeon wings . i order some ( 16 ) wings from them on wed night along w pasta & pizza & a the cookie pie . everything was okay but the wing were so small .
i would give zero star if there is an option . 1 . the attitude from the manager ( owner ) is horrible . she clearly does n't understand what the customer service is about and she does n't know how to treat customer with respect .
terrible customer services . gave me the wrong food and refuse to exchange .
i usually love this place , this time absolutely terrible rice was crunch . orange beef was chewing and the garlic chicken had no flavor very disappointed threw everything out
horrible establishment inpatient stylists , out of all of the colors i was interested in , disorganized , overpriced , horrible ! do not waste your money
stay stay away . nothing professional here . ben is a terrible owner and person . do n't do it to your precious hair !
have ordered from this location too many times to count and honestly have never had an issue until today . driver claims ca n't find my address in his gps - confirmed the address driver rudely interrupted me and said ca n't find it . ''
i purchased a jacket for my friend using my credit card , i was told by the nice young lady that although thier return policy stated merchandise credit only , she would refund my money back to my credit card if i needed to return .
sloppy . my gel nails were super thick and polish was all over my skin . wo n't go back .
worst experience ever worst experience ever had to walk out after five minutes and go across the street wanted to charge me triple what any place normally charges .
this place is a joke . i ordered a pizza for delivery and was told 30 minutes . i called after an hour and was told it was in the oven . i decided to go pick it up .
i am so glad i did n't go with this company , i was trying to find a cab for my mother and when i called the operator to see about getting one she was so rude i ended up finding another , thank u ms .
went to sun valley as they are near my home & they had advertised christmas trees from $ 29.95 . had nice looking trees on the lot but nothing below $ 60.00 for a 5 foot tall douglas fir !
we just ordered take-out because this restaurant is close to where we live . we ordered chicken tenders as well as chips and salsa . three tenders came with the appetizer and the chips and salsa had barely any salsa as well as chips .
these guys sold me a car a couple months ago . since then i 've had to fix multiple oil leaks , buy a new radiator , replace the belt tensioner , get a new battery , and fix a tail light .
i 'm with the other reviewers who bought a living social deal for this company . they wo n't even return calls to set up the appointments . i hope they enjoy my $ 49 for a detail they never did .
could n't get my insurance right , no help and rude .
we recently hired b & b to move us and had the worst experience . on the day of our move they never showed up ! talk about stressed out ! they were unprofessional in the way they handled it and i would not recommend them .
ladies please stay away from this place the service is terrible 350.00 is what i threw in the trash by coming here the place is a joke im never coming back here again i hate my hair i should have left when i had the chance worst mistake ever !
awful service . i only would have given it a 2 because its nice to look at . but its way too hyped . if youre going to do fancy and simple do it right . its quite pricy for the portions .
went in to see how much my iphone 4 would be worth . i was talking to the sales associate kyle , all was going well until he said he would n't jew '' me out of a good deal . i was shocked !
car wash review only : i 'm not a drive-thru car wash novice so i realize you get what you pay and i did n't even get a $ 6 car wash in my opinion ! my truck looked pretty much the same as when it entered .
went in to upgrade to the iphone 6 and they were out of stock . they said they had no idea when they would be getting a shipment in .
the location was bought out in june 2015 , since then my monthly fee has gone up twice ! this is unacceptable & the office guy had a dont care attitude ! dont recommend this place to anyone !
urgh urgh urgh ! some of the worst customer service i have ever received . i decided to switch from one of my signature mac products for a change ; i ended up with a pressed powder from makeup forever .
run away and whatever you do do n't give these jerks your phone number . they will call - over and over and over .
this restaurant does n't receive a star . they should be shut down already by the health department . customer service sucks and very unorganized it 's a shame .
fox news '' on the t.v . loudly . manager unwilling to change the channel or even turn down the volume . sad . wo n't be back .
ordered thru eat24 and they never showed up . tried to call for info they do n't answer their phone goes to voicemail . left us very hungry and angry after working all day and no dinner . order had been confirmed too .
you want cheap ? you get what you pay for here . this place ruined 3 of my best shirts . the 3rd was the last strike . we put up with the poorly dry cleaned and laundered shirts for about a year because the price was right .
they had no idea what paige jeans were ! these people have no design or retail knowledge if it hit them in the face ! came in with salvatore ferragamo . the idiots had no idea what the brand was !
this shitty as bartender had 3 people at the bar today . took 10 min from when i walked in to ask me what i want . got a flat miller lite .
terrible service . drive thru takes forever ! and they ca n't take a minute to check if they have an ingredient . instead they just lie and say they do n't have it . go to another location . do n't start your day here .
we stopped in for lunch at 2pm and got seated but not waited on . tables that were seated after us were waited on . seems to be a lack of help . we were looking forward to the meal .
buyer beware ! do not take any super expensive jewelry here to get sized or worked on - just go to the mall ! this guy is super nice , but very sneaky ! he shaved my engagement ring !
called sunday to get a pickup at 5:15 am monday morning . had a tight schedule to catch a flight off of the island airport . no problem , right ? stood outside waiting at 5:15 - no car . called at 5:20 to see what 's up .
finding it really hard to find a good tapas bar in toronto , which is my favourite style of eating so that 's been unfortunate . this place was recommended by a friend , but it was a huge fail .
had to do another update . i 've had so many issues with this company . i 've had scheduling conflicts ; the maids showing up too late or too early .
pretty awful effort here . too bad it 's he only option in the area for fish and chips .
straight awful and disgusting . i 've been wanting to try these ever since like a decade ago when i first saw harold and kumar 's adventure to white castle and these did not deliver .
not very good . i have steak burrito and it tastes like it was a can of corn beef hash . the texture was the same too . also the place was very loud for 10 am . tv was on loud with a drama show .
i wish i could give this dental practice zero stars . the one hygienist who normally does my teeth is very rude and short with me at all times . very sarcastic also , in an failing attempt to be funny .
not good at all . crust was black because it was so burnt and the rest of it was so greasy . just overall bad pizza .
the slowest staff at any starbucks around the pittsburgh area . i 'd love to see how any one of their workers would fare downtown on a monday morning . i went in today at 12:00pm .
this location is closed as of march 11 , 2016 . too bad ! it was one of my regular coffee spots .
i eat out a lot but never made reviews until today but i felt i had a civic duty to warn you especially with these rather suspiciously positive reviews . this place is horrible . this food is not authentic and poorly made .
i do not recommend this firm . they are extremely unprofessional , incompetent , & rude . they do n't return calls .
do not eat the gf crust if you have celiac ! it 's definitely not gf . i usually can deal with a little bit of unavoidable contamination but by my reaction their crust does actually contain gluten . be careful .
worst service i have ever experienced . anywhere . i ca n't believe mcdonalds would allow this store to be this bad .
may i just ask , what is your disaster preparedness plan ? you have none .
i had one of the worst experiences as a customer at this establishment . i was looking forward to enjoying sunday football after my husband told me what a great time he had last year . once we arrived we were greeted by hostile and visibly stressed hostesses .
i am generally an accepting person . hence it is not lightly i leave a 1 star review for a business . the reason ? total lack of professional behaviour on the staff 's part .
i went to the az mills mall in tempe az . the bathrooms were disgusting . i brought it to the store managers attention and his walls went up as if he was not paid enough to clean the bathrooms .
came here with my youngest while waiting for a prescription to be filled next door at walgreens . worst one i 've ever been to . the ladies restroom was filthy ! no soap and paper all over the floor .
the owner of this store , jim , s wrote me an angry personal msg due to my review . he has been reported to yelp .
if you like bad food and mediocre service this place is a must ! ordered the blackened shrimp pasta alfredo . ask upon being served if the shrimp were blackened and was told by two different servers that that is the way they do it here .
very disappointed with what i ordered . i had ordered a 10 inch chocolate mousse cake with tuxedo outside and do n't get me wrong it looked amazing but in comparison to the price i paid i really expected something better tasting .
used this company as a videographer for my wedding . it still brings me to tears when i watch it . the quality is terrible , an iphone is better . the color is very distorted and off . i would never recommend them for video work .
this place sucks ! first they overcharged us and refused to fix it . then they did n't have any lemons . i asked if they had oil vinegar for my salad and they said no .
i wish i did n't even have to give these idiots a review . they charge you before they start your nails & they refuse to refund your money and redo your nails if you do n't like them .
i should have just lit $ 75 on fire then at least i would have enjoyed it better . had a 20 minute wait even though the place was half full . it was lobster fest so i ordered the seafood feast , everything was overcooked .
poor customer service .
i really wanted to like this bar . we went here for a birthday and to watch the nba game . there were approx 10-15 people in our group . nice place to chill since they have outdoor games and beer selection . the service was terrible !
a friend recommended this doctor , 15 mins on hold before i hung up . could n't even make an appointment .
i wish i could give 0 stars . i usually go to dutch bros. in tempe , paradise valley , and mesa -- never have i had such dreadful service in my entire life .
if you are like me and have real problems then this place is not for you . i waited for over two hours for nothing , then when i left they gave me someone else cards . i had to drive back to fix that with no licence .
i called reservations desk , spoke with a dominique . we wanted to reserve a room for a wedding and were willing to pay an extra fee for early check-in . i know early check-in is possible because i used to work for a travel agency .
i do n't want to even give a star because it is n't worth it . people tried to steal the rims and tires off our chevy tahoe . apparently there was a history of this happening told to us by the cops .
do not use this company . two times in a row they left the gates open in my backyard , causing my dog to escape and run into traffic . after the first incident , i called and they were very apologetic , promising it would never happen again .
under new management ! i have to say that this place has gotten a lot worse within the past few months . i 'm saying this service and food wise .
do not ever bring your pets here ! this is the worst experience i 've ever had with a veterinarian in my entire life . i 've never met human beings who are so inconsiderate and care less about animals welfare .
yuck ! went on valentine 's day . was given a bad table and the service was n't really good . i ordered a pizza with steak - it was n't that good . the plates had a strange damp smell and i started throwing up hours later .
have been coming here for years previous reviews have been decent . today i took my car in and sitting waiting for the car noticed no cars were moving through the wash . went and asked if they were short handed .
pretty sure that if you 're a dermatologist , you should look at my skin while i 'm in your office . not here . instead , the doctor looked at his computer and continually asked me questions like who 's treating you now ? ''
i attended this school based on a recommendation from a friend , and honestly the first impressions were pretty decent , the lady at the front desk was courteous and very helpful , she guided me through the whole registration process .
ordered the carne asada nachos , we were maybe only the 2nd customer in the place . it took forever to receive our food and when we did they forgot our beans inside the nachos ( who does that ? ) and got the order wrong .
this place was close by and i definitely needed my little pup groomed . told them to cut it short , trim the face and leave the tail . when i picked her up , her face was shaved down completely , her whole body was shaved uneven .
met my now fiancée here 7 years ago , it used to have an amazing crowd and casual attitude . one side was a dj , bar and dance floor , the other half was a mellow karaoke bar with with pool tables .
warning ! i made reservations for 2 and they never sent the address of where to go for the ride . then they fraudulently charged my credit card which they still have not reimbursed 6 weeks later . stay away !
only submitting this review for the 50 dollar off promo code . furniture quality is disappointing . service is terrible . a lot of attitude from the customer reps .
no more night time security . no more basic maintence to the complex so trash is everywhere . and who cares if your upstairs neighbor buys a drum set and practices at 11pm , 1am , 6am . so on .
i am very disappointed . i brought in a coupon for $ 3 for double cheeseburger , small fry , small drink and all i got was single cheeseburger , half a box of small frys and no drink .
wow - this place is a complete joke . we got our silverware and bread after our entree , no one knew who our server was , and to top it all off , they charged my card twice .
3 hr wait then finally was taken back . there is nothing immediate about this facility . the ladies at the desk can not give any clue for a time wait .
incredibly understaffed . it took an hour to be seated and be given menus . when there were n't many people at all . outrageous . there was only one waitress as the lunch rush came in and everything was an absolute disaster . never again .
this salon is dirty , i 've seen the nail tech take a tray that was used for another customers pedi and want to use it for my mani , dirt and nails all over the floor .
i called in to as a question and was hung up on . twice . i decided to get breakfast at carl 's jr . instead .
terrible food . straight from a sysco freezer truck to the deep fryer to our table . nothing fresh at all . the waitress tried getting us out as fast as she could even though the place was empty on a wednesday night at 6 pm .
way too expensive for the service . and the good is a bit to be desired . they should call this place chinese spice as there is a very small portion of thai cuisine on the menu .
thankfully , this store is going out of business . they bought out albertson 's , layed off most of the employees , increased prices , and had a terrible selection . all of this just to go out of business a few months later . shame on them .
i 'm honestly shocked to see this company has more than 1 star reviews . they are late with furniture delivery , and not just by a few hours or a day . a whole week . completely unacceptable and unprofessional .
worst latte that i have ever had . no foam , all milk . gross .
i happened upon this place on my recent trip late in the evening & noticed that the front door clearly stated in big white lettering that the kitchen was open until close .
called the fairlawn store 3 times on friday , asked for seafood dept because i wanted to see if they had black pearl salmon . each time i was transferred to a line and no one picked up , call was n't rerouted back to main number .
do n't waist you time . they pressure you into signing up for their 3 day seminar for $ 2000 . not to mention their other paid seminars . and if you still do n't bite you can get a dvd for $ 20 .
this great clips used to be better . i have a job , i go to college , and i have an internship , so needless to say , i have very small windows for when i can get hair cuts .
i went here today because i 'd noticed sensitivity in one of my teeth . i expected a cavity .
brought my sentra here for an oil change after buying the car from this dealership . my service was automatically scheduled when i purchased the car but it did n't work for my schedule .
there is no doubt that falbo makes great pizza , but their service is terrible . ordered a pizza during a time of day that should n't be all that busy and it took two hours and fifteen minutes for our pizza to arrive .
was n't even there for 10 minutes and had to leave . i was treated like i was a bother and was never even greeted .
avoid this hellhole ! we have brought our dog here for many years . suddenly new management changes their pet policy .
our lyft driver claimed this place was cheaper than where we were going ( lees ) , total and complete lie . we wasted our time coming here , the prices are the exact same as if you were to go to the cvs on the strip .
ca n't tell you how the food is , because we never even made it through the ordering process . tried to place a phone order for work .
fuddruckers in the casino has better coffee . this place is starbucks everything , but not called starbucks possibly because the people do n't care , the muffins are stale and the coffee is burnt .
ahh . the fiesta henderson poker room . it 's the closest poker room from the crib . if you like playing no limit poker , then this card room is defiantly not for you .
worst airline ever ! delayed our flight from san diego to las vegas twice . then , close the flight an hour before departure so we have no time to check our bags ( had to pay $ 30 each to check them btw !
tried to call ashley in customer service , no response oh and we threw away your order . hope the 110 $ you made off me is worth the bad press and business you lose .
jenny is very rude ! she is the women with the long black hair and in the 1st nail booth .
not very good food , general tao is hard , no actual chicken ; just batter , but is the only option in the area if looking for asian ( canadian ) inspired food .
our apartment was a mess when we got the keys . immediately after moving in we realized that the unit is infested with roaches .
located near the bathroom ( sort of middle ) , in the upper level food court ( from the elevator , this is the 3rd floor ) .
the customer service i received at this store was unbelievably poor . i will never recommend this place to others . the fixtures which i began to order were priced way above retail and this reflected a supposed contractors 30 off of the manufacturers recommended pricing '' .
this was the worst buffet i have had in vegas so far and i have been to quite a few trust me . if you are looking for anything even medium quality please do n't waste your money . we paid 58 dollar for sunday brunch for two .
i live in this area and i first thought it would be a descent place .first experience menudo was descent but overpriced . second time came with friends only because they wanted to try it . .worst experience ever .
we have had dinner here in the past and it was very good however the service was the worst i have had in years . the waiter took drink orders and it took over 20 minutes to get drinks .
i bought a groupon for laser . and im very disappointed because i didnt see any results . the technician was always very nice and kind , getting a hold of them by phone or anything was annoying .
this use to be the best place i knew ! until they started messing up my order , even giving me the wrong sauces . so disappointed !
if i could rate this place a zero i would . i took my truck to get some smog work done .
what a joke . if i could leave less stars , i would . went in to open an account and get a cashiers check .
4 of the 6 drafts were out . took a look at the bottled selection . asked which of them was an ipa as i could n't really see the cooler . i have no idea '' . good talk .
worst dining experience of my life . made a reservation and upon arrival a server wanted to seat us at one of the tables .
this the worst mcdonald 's i ever visited , we even witnessed a rat ( mouse ) at the mens washroom , definitely a result of the low hygiene levels and dirty floor in the restaurant , beside the ac was colder than the outdoor shill wind
high prices and arrogant customer service . loved this location when it was an albertson 's store , but my first visit after it transitioned to haggen will be my last . prices were significantly higher with no noticeable difference in quality .
if there was a way to chose no stars i would 've .
every time i go to anna 's to purchase items i leave empty handed because the store has insufficient stock .
service is poor , but breakfast is usually pretty tasty . today i got a salad though , and all of the tomatoes were rotten . so gross .
most barros locations i have been too , are good . this one was terrible . we ordered some garlic bread to go with our pizza and what we got was burnt to a crisp on both sides .
the food is reasonably priced , the service is excellent but not too impressed with the food or my experience . i ordered a torta and it was very simple not much flavor at all ! their salsas are watered down .
did not like this place at all . this was an all of a sudden trip because we had a death in the family so we needed a room asap .
i brought my phone here to get the cracked screen replaced and they replaced it . within a week the screen shattered again and when i took my phone back to this place i had them replace it again and put a tempered glass .
i do love panda , depending on the location . this location though , the first few times i went it was n't too bad , but this time there was a worker named elizabeth , that was absolutely rude as hell !
avoid this place as a customer and when seeking employment , they are nice people but they have poor management skills
not the best walmart . really bad experience here with their customer service . this lady cashier name rona '' looked miserable and unhappy . ca n't even say hi or hello . if you hate your job , get another ! do n't make me hate this place !
went with the lowest expectations and was n't disappointed . not a fan of buffets or of fried foods or fatty foods . the clam chowder was ok . the salads were ok. no alcohol here . the hot fudge dispenser at the desert bar was empty .
came here for dinner with the wife . waited 23 minutes for the sashimi . only 4 patrons in the restaurant . when it came out it was frozen !
this is really just another mcdonald 's the food is good but later you will wish you did n't eat it from all the grease . the real shocker is when you sit down and see huge bible verses on the wall .
zero stars . customer service is horrific ! products . well . you get what you pay for . just horrible quality furniture . if you think you are getting a good deal , you 're not ! go elsewhere .
i ordered the extra spicy schezuan tofu but was given a mild hunan tofu . i politely told the waiter ( grumpy guy named mike ) that i was given the wrong order .
most confusing airport ever and there is construction every which way you turn . also seems to be very under staffed long lines not a lot of employees
went to go pick up my pizza an hour after i ordered it and they had n't even started cooking it yet
asked them to repair a possible leaky tire on my practically new car . they did so but not without charging me $ 21.95 to do so . really ?
terrible seats in the plane . nice people and good model but the planes are so stripped down and terribly uncomfortable .
do not go if you have a peanut allergy .
worst mexican restaurant in town . where do i begin , 1st chicken enchiladas : not fresh at all , seems like they just rolled some chicken in a tortilla poured sauce over it and cut a slice of cheese on top of it .
worse place i 've stopped at in las vegas , save your self your day , and do n't waste your time at this spot , look elsewhere , you 'll do yourself a favor .
i took my car to get washed 3 times . the first time my windows still had tape on them that i requested to be removed . the second time the same thing happened . the third time my ring was stolen out of my center console .
i do n't understand the appeal of kind exchange . is it for people who think thrift stores smell ? i have never bought anything at this location , or any of the other ones . and there are so many locations !
charge is for the wrong material . and called me back after a day saying i owed him more money ! unprofessional !
poor management . 1 server 1 cook on a saturday . would hate to work here . upset customers .
i was never a big dq fan to begin with , but on a hot summer day driving around the suburbs we thought why not ? '' unfortunately , this particular location lacked a few things that most of the newer locations have : a dining room seating area .
the waitress was very nice . martini 's are very small and way overpriced , wine is overpriced . food is a bit overpriced , i ask that my burger be on rye toast instead of a bun & they charged me $ 1.50 extra .
this is the absolute worst place i have ever lived . if you like cockroaches , poor management , and lousy service . sign a lease here . i highly suggest if you like yourself and your family . even the slightest bit , take yourself elsewhere .
high pressure sales . very pushy to make a decision on the spot . would not give me the square footage of the rooms nor a square footage price . would not leave me a business card or quote of any kind .
this was one of my favorite places to eat but today was a really awkward & uncomfortable experience .
went in for my first appointment for leg and back pain . i sat in the waiting room for 40 minutes .
usually do n't have any issues coming here but lately service has n't been great . employees do n't seem to like their job and it shows in their service .
they displayed gross negligence . ordered pants that were out of stock in-store that would be shipped to my house . salesman said that he would call me once they arrived in-store . no problem . did not receive any contact whatsoever for a week .
food is poor and the service is somehow worse . th atmosphere is nice but that 's about the only plus .
i am a total cupcake connoisseur , and i am amazed this place is still in business with the mad hatter right across the street !
would not come here again . the rice took about 20 minutes to come out and it was n't even fresh . it was hard . the prices were excessive for such small portions . customer service was lacking .
the worst car wash ever ! i knew the $ 3.00 advertised price was too good to be true , but assumed that price applied if you filled up with gas . what it really means is for $ 3.00 you get a quick rinse '' .
we 've been here a couple of times and have found the service slowly diminishing but the food has always been well cooked .
what a truly awful place . the service was atrocious , the food was rock hard , soggy when you expect it to be dry and dry when your expect it to be soggy .
we came when they were just opening . the service was extremely slow . apparently there were two people that was helping our table , but only one ever showed up . we orders the prix fixe . i did n't like the mushroom soup at all .
the service is horrible . our waitress asian girl with thick eyeliner absolutely has the worst attitude . although the food is good and the price is so affordable . it just made the whole experience bad .
never go to this place . not professional , not kind , poor knowledge . even my husband didnt have any problems , they sent him to the emergency room because their data reading was wrong and they said it looks strange '' !
do n't expect good customer service unless your a mild age white person , or look like you just got off the course . not once was i asked if i needed any help . -_-
fellow las vegans if you ever need service on your auto please do yourself a huge favor and do not take your car to ted wiens tire & auto on warm springs and eastern . we took our car there .
we used to go to bww every sunday . my son loves the place . but , no kidding , the past 4 to 5 times we have eaten here i have had to get up and go track down a server .
good food . but did n't really enjoy the attitude served with my burgers . ahem , melinda .
they need to do much better with their $ 5 sandwiches - poor portions . the delivery guy was the best part of the order , he called and was very nice even though he had to wait a few minutes for me .
horrible service .
after two years of membership i just quit this place . it 's turned into a complete shit hole . no hot water i the showers . .ever . half the equipment is broken constantly .
save your money and save your time . you can get a much better haircut from another barber for the same price and hopefully they do not stink like cigarettes .
service was terrible . we went as a group of 10 people . when we went to pay our bill they refused to split our bill because they only had one credit card machine .
from the moment we walked in it was filthy i honestly went home and showered after . the decor was tacky and lots of dust everywhere . service was okay but the food was not good at all .
this is to the tall asian mixed guy who was taking order today . please leave your depression life at home and bring a good attitude to work .
food is popular and well known in the little town of henderson . service is horrible . worst ive seen , probably ever . place is always packed to the walls busy , regardless of the horrible staff .
i 've gotten better haircuts at great clips for $ 20 . the girl had no idea what she was doing , and took 3 1 2 hours to cut mine and my friend 's hair . and our hair is short . i have a mohawk .
do not waste your money . came here on a glowing recommendation from my sister and brother in law , but sorely disappointed . i ordered the coriander shrimp ( 15.00 ) and garlic scallops ( 17.00 ) with a coconut soup- all inedible .
okay , that is one star too many . great potential on the karaoke as they have it every night . but good luck getting into the rotation . we sat for 2 hours and never did get called .
no ever again for 14.95 catfish bland no salt or pepper , soggy oysters , soggy okra to be all fried and hush puppies with small cup slaw mind you dinner plate .
disappointed with the amount of food i got on my sub . i ordered a turkey sub and got a few slices of meat . then when i asked the worker for extra onions she gave me the smallest pinch of onions .
i hate this chipotle . it 's dirty and parking is the worst ! the guacamole was way too salty and the red onion was in huge chunks , also the chicken was defintely on the burnt crunchy and not very good side .
i went downtown to meet my husband on his lunch break for a quick bite to eat . he wanted subway ( which mind you is right next store ) . i said hey lets check out this place , i can get some nachos .
first you will note that the wraps here cost about $ 5 more than anywhere else in the city . the decor is cheap , sit down , bare bones . a luncheon place that does n't really command $ 11.99 for a chicken wrap and salad '' .
bought tickets for the habs and pens game from a third party vendor because no tickets were available from the bell centre .
worst place ever ! management is so bad in addition to k & d management contract is crazy , money thieves . not clean place . fire alarm went on late at night . not recommended to anybody .
i keep coming back here but i do n't know why . i guess because it is close to home . but i am never truly satisfied . we just took my brand new 2016 traverse on a 2400 mile road trip .
just ordered food from the truck outside noda brewery and could not be more disappointed . waited 30+ minutes on a very empty stomach . ordered the red velvet chicken and waffles . waffle was soggy and red was food coloring , not a traditional red velvet .
she arrived 30 minutes early . i pulled up and she 's sitting there in her fancy car . i did n't have a good feeling .
been here few times in past 2 months , but today was a different experience . walked into the establishment and i was basically ignored for first 5 minutes . the guy at the cash did n't even greet us or said anything .
this place is called a latin american bar restaurant but we spent the night listening to hip hop music ( like any other place nearby ) because the only place with latin music was the restaurant downstairs which closes at 12am . fail !
disgusting and terrible medical care ! all thier offices in the valley are small and filthy . you will have to wait for months to get an appointment . i suggest paying more for better coverage , if your on medicare .
i 've been to numerous hickory tavern locations around the city of charlotte and surrounding towns and this is probably the least impressive location that i have been to .
they just opened this store i come to get my favorite thing on the menu and they say it 's frozen and not ready . what is the point of opening a new location if the food is not ready to serve ? very disappointed .
do not recommend this flight at all . you get what you pay for but just flew to miami on this flight and it was a horrible experience . will not be using spirit anymore .
food was semi ok and they did n't refresh the trays of food as often as they should 've but i guess for the cheap price that 's the quality you get
had a coupon and thought why not try it out . i heard from a friend that it was really delicious pizza . wrong ! took family from out of town there . mistake . felt so bad . ordered two pizzas . both over cooked !
i do n't even want to rate 1 star to this restaurant ! horrible management . i witnessed an extremely horrible scene when i went there for a nice dinner with my husband . the manager insulted a group of people for not having space for them !
came in here with my girlfriend . she got treated terribly and unprofessionally specifically by one of the asian nurses . do not come here
bowling alley nightclub '' . outdated and dirty . bartenders demand a tip . wo n't be back .
this branch is stupid . i live in ny and someone in this branch in ohio processed a withdrawal from my checking account by typing in the wrong numbers , what a bunch of idiots .
went a week ago sun to watch football and have drinks and food . ordered a personal pizza and it took at least a half-hour whereas it should have been not more than 15 minutes .
horrible ! the women do okay hair but their attitudes are terrible . you just do not want individuals with all that negative energy doing your hair . really take a look at the two owners the sisters '' they do not have healthy hair .
worst experience of my life . had to get color and cut correction which cost me another $ 200 . nice girl but very inexperienced and just out of school .
rainbow roll for $ 12 with barely any fish and that too with the salmon getting brown .
i received a coupon in the mail for a free pizza and they would n't honor it . i 'd be more upset if they were better than second rate .
lame and overrated . awkward effort by the girls on the microphone . low energy and tacky .
this service has been so unreliable that we filled out a form with amazon to make sure they would not be used to attempt deliver any more of our orders . this is very easy to do buy calling or emailing amazon customer service .
i 've been to this location many times and every time the ordering process is ridiculous .
mediocre food , super overpriced . when i went to pay the waitress literally took my debit card out of my hand and typed in a five dollar tip and made me pay it .
waited 20 minutes ( with a reservation ) on a sunday evening . was served a cold and tasteless prime rib . two other steaks had to be sent back because they were not cooked properly .
do n't agree with the return policy as a store credit . i got buyers remorse and i went to return it . store credit for over $ 400 it is ridiculous .
the worst gym ever ! they do n't communicate terms and conditions with you and it is so difficult to remove yourself from the membership if you want to . the management is so unfriendly and rude . the training programs are such a waste of money .
this restaurant sucks ! we went here and were waiting for 2 hours ! they sat multiple people in front of us . this is ridiculous ! then when we finally got seated . we ordered and waited another hour ! the food was n't good either .
terrible , greasy food . it 's offensive to call this chinese food . the only good thing i can say is it 's cheap and fast . do yourself a favor and avoid this franchise and find a local mom and pop chinese restaurant .
it 's never been a great place , but it 's unfortunately gotten worse . we had the american standard burgers which were possibly the most greasy burgers either of us have had from any joint we 've been to .
let me preface this by saying that i love coffee bean coffee . it is tasty and hits the spot , every time . the service at this location absolutely sucks .
rip off ! worst dentistry in charlotte . find somewhere else . i did n't get what i came for and was still charged for the service i did n't receive
worst fucken place ever messed up my eye brows went back told her and she said oh well come back monday 3 days later ! gave me a number to call and it 's a disconnect number . worst service i have ever had !
horrible place . dirty . old beaten up chairs and nail stations . my gel french manicure had bubbles in it . i had to point out the imperfections to the nail guy and ask him to do it over .
horribly slow and i waited 1.5 hours before having to leave . zero stars . go somewhere else !
worst coffee ever , was n't drinkable at all . food was n't good either . i asked for nutella banana crepes , as i went there early morning before catching my plane , they did n't have it so they brought me pancakes with beacon .
jackie , i did inform you guys . i brought it in , they fixed what was slipping , and said that was not part of the work that they did .
i called in on a saturday asking if it be ok to bring my car in on monday to get 4 new tires . the guy on the phone said it would be fine .
all i can say is if you go , do n't run a tab ! i was charged an extra 30 dollars on my credit card , so i called to speak to a manager .
this mcdonalds is located at the queen west - king west - queensway and roncesvalles intersection so there is some traffic but most of the people are just passing through .
worst resteraunt i 've been to in a while . the food was subpar from your average chinese resteraunt and the service was just terrible .
very unfriendly staff . very rude to the customers . not willingly to help . this place does not have a professional environment and they do not encourage or train their staff how to behave with the customers .
i like the food , but the service needs some work . today they decided that my turkey sandwich would be better on white bread instead of sourdough bread , although they never mentioned anything to me .
i went on a saturday . the eggs were n't cooked right ! my omelette was over cooked . the service was horrible ! once i was served the waitress disappeared . i did n't finish my omelette . i got up paid and left .
hardly can get an order correct . either add stuff or forget to add . see staff eating while they 're prepping orders . yes , they have gloves on , but the hand that feeds goes back to the food they 're handling .
the pizza was plain . told me i would love the 5 cheese blend but the pizza is not special at all .
barely had any issues after they fixed our leaking bathroom sink and sagging ceiling from the air conditioner .
my laser tag gun did not work . the game ended before they could fix it . this place is fun only if you play with about 20 members . i went here twice .
okay , i 'm going counter to all the positive reviews here , but this is the worst city park i 've been to in the phoenix metro area , and i 've been to most of them the 10+ years that i 've lived here .
this company is an absolute nightmare . i was given a warranty through hsa from the sellers when i purchased my home . the contractors they sent were incompetent , and required several visits , and each visit required i pay yet another $ 75 deductible .
i was on time for my appointment . the stylist was finishing up with someone with super short hair . i was told i will be with you in a minute . no offer of water or coffee . 37 minutes later someone else washed my hair .
i hired this company to replace a main water line that had sprung a leak . when i met with the estimator repairman i specifically told him i wanted a single piece of all copper pipe from the meter to the house .
you know how you go to a place for the first time and its totally awesome. then you go back sometime later and the experience is not as good then the first. thats rio mirage in el mirage , az .
just walked out myself . only 1 table full in the whole restaurant and they still could n't take our order . lady who sat us down did n't smile once and was counting money when we walked in . waited 20 minutes with our waters and walked out .
dang ! a one hour flight , two people , round trip and our bags were $ 120 lol ! i ca n't remember how much the flight was but i remember is was dollar store cheap .
just left after being completely ignored . it was 8 pm and they close at 9 pm . we walked in and we were completely ignored . the cook was washing dishes and noticed us standing there . he just ignored us .
there was an older lady that had grey shoulder length hair and she could n't even count money she should n't even be working at the bank . she was very rude and will kill you with her evil eyes .
the food is what you get from a franchise pizza place . it is better than some and not as good as some but that is a personal preference . the help is horrible . the service is even worse .
while the service was polite if a bit aloof , the food was a disaster . i requested huevos rancheros . my god . tasteless and my husband requested pancakes . .he barely ate them . they look unappetizing and they tasted . .like something was off .
this place is pretty bad for both drink and service . like other reviewer mentioned , the owners yelled and rushed you to order . i do n't know how there is such business like this still exist around .
jason was a very good salesperson . we paid for a trust to be established . he said he would get our house placed into the trust along with our banking accounts . since he collected the money it has next to impossible to get a hold him .
this safeway always has vagrants out front . very sketchy and somewhat dangerous . my wife and i were threatened with a knife while waking to our car in the parking lot . i would advise anyone and everyone to avoid this safeway at all cost .
terrible . this place is n't any busier than any other starbucks i 've been to .
save your money , do n't rent from them. we waited about two hours for picking up rv & instruction . we started driving , after one hour we realized how old is the rv .
it smells like there is mold in this location or a cheap spray to cover up the smell of weed .
la favorita is probably the only hispanic grocer in the area . they know this and do carry a lot of products , a variety of ready to eat and packaged products to make at home .
if i could give this place zero stars , i would . unbelievable . my friend ordered chicken tenders and fries , and it came out with a long , dark , thick , hair ( photos to come ) and it was disgusting .
really shady operation . i emailed them back and forth a few times about getting counters put in our kitchen . when we were finally ready to go i confirmed the price and told them we could move forward .
cold , slow , tasteless food . worst sonic i 've been to .
i wish i could give this place 0 stars because 1 star is too generous . two of the worst experiences i 've had at a restaurant have been at this mcdonald 's in the past two days .
geo holidays is one of the many time share companies located in las vegas . i find them to be extremely poor . they are found near the jockey club . that is the only good thing i can say about this organization .
do not go here ! i 'm serious ! i went in and i wanted to do like an ombré . dark from the roots and blonde all threw out the rest of my hair . when i left my hair was orange .
4 of us tries to go here on december 6th . we made a reservation online only to get to the restaurant and it be empty . the doors were locked , there was no sign or the restaurant and no answer on the phone .
hmmm . shall we try a little math problem ?
atrocious customer service . we 've been waiting for two orders for about a month now . when we placed the orders , everything we bought was listed as in stock . ''
i really wanted to like this place because my gf 's little brother and sister love the place but it 's just way too expensive for what they serve . the ramen is straight out of the pack , add an egg , and costs $ 8 .
all i can say is run away ! what a terribly run company . loyal renters for many years , during the time we needed multiple repairs done on the house .
been here twice . it 's a neighborhood bar , which i 'm a fan of . but in any business & for women , a clean decent restroom is very important . this was so disgusting i ca n't step foot in ever again .
absolutely ridiculous ! people waiting in the sun and only one person taking orders ! shame on the management or lack thereof ! if you can not plan for busy times then you need to rethink your business !
we came in at 130 they close at 2 on saturday . we were told 13 people were ahead of us . there was only five , and a couple of them looked like they were together .
the line with a reservation is an hour and a half long . they have 7 computer stations with only 2-3 people working .
i have just had my third occurrence in five months of a package apparently being delivered somewhere other than my address . do these people not have gps in their delivery vans or smart phones ? or brains even ?
would be less if i could . went for lunch today and did not feel welcome at all . regulars taken care of , strangers not so much . took a while to get a drink and never provided a menu or an option .
room service wings were over cooked , dry , with bad flavor . inedible . the fries were ice cold so i ca n't judge the flavor since i did n't take a bite . ordered an arnold palmer and got unsweetened tea .
used to be a good spot about 2 years ago but quality is very hit or miss now . sometimes i get amazing pupusas , but more often than not i get completely dry , empty pancakes . their horchata is n't as great anymore either .
the hairdresser was at least 20 minutes late for our appointment and never called the salon to say whether or not she was coming so i left . i was on a tight schedule and could n't risk waiting longer to find out if she would show .
ruined my lunch and almost missed the plane .
hotel review : my experience and my opinion : horrible customer service and staff . no apologies for the tons of things that went wrong . a simple we 're sorry '' would have gone a long way .
they are so rude here . saw a mirror they had just posted on offer up . came in and they did n't have it and even worse they did n't bother to try and help me to see if they had it or anything .
at the end of the menu it is advised to say if you have food allergies only for the waitress to give you attitude if asked for an ingredient to be taken out of your plate . poor service , average food .
went here on sunday around 1:45pm . we were a group of 5 and were completely ignored while standing in line for 15 minutes . there were empty tables but two groups ahead of us were still waiting to be seated .
i had a bad experience with the man working behind the counter . i went with my friend , telling her how good this place was , and the man behind the counter was so nasty to me . it was actually embarrassing .
service is the pits , 0 . they never answer phones . the company customer service connects to the store manager 's line , where you leave 2 messages and he too never responds .
worst service in the venetian . i sat in my seat for 20 minutes and not a single server came by .
had a male manicurist who did not speak an ounce of english . i went in for for a simple manicure . it usually takes half an hour , this place took 1.25 hours and the work was absolutely horrible .
my burger was really dry , and everything seemed to be off a little in regards to taste and efficiency .
just like everyone else on here , this location sucks . i booked a car and when i showed up they changed the price of the rental on me without notifying me .
has a confirmed 8-12 appointment . never showed up ! waited 4 hours and i did not even receive a phone call . better think twice about calling them when it is 110 degrees outside
if i could give this place a less than one star review i would . i bought a massage for his place thru groupon for my niece who is the mother of two special needs kids and could use some relaxation .
stayed at the mandalay bay for the weekend came to starbucks 3 times and all 3 times they 're was some kind of drama . these ladies do n't give a shit . prepare to have a coffee with a side of drama .
if only zero stars was a possible . my phone call would n't go through for some reason , bill called me back and cussed me out asking if i was calling just to piss him off .
i came here with my boyfriend for a drink and some apps on a friday around 8pm . the food was awful - the wings tasted freezer burnt , calamari was bland , and the server did n't even check in to see if we were satisfied .
par below expectations .food is being served right from the refrigerator .not sure how many days old it was . it does n't lives up up to the expectations .
my father was collecting canadian tire money for years . he gave his collection to me for christmas and told me to go get winter tires for my car , which was needed and i wasnt about to do it .
some of the theaters have ok picture quality . currently watching a movie in theater 1 .
worst kfc ever ! i have a relative that lives near here , so i go here periodically . every time is a disaster . they always have some big issue . one time they said they were out of half the menu .
i 'm not really one to complain about the satisfaction of fast food , but the quality of the burger king i had today in the charlotte airport was disgusting . my bread was hard and stale , my patty was cold , and my fries were under cooked .
poor service . the servers ca n't see you waiting at the entry for a table . no greeting . i 've been there 4 times and same every time . food is blah , they do n't use fresh blueberries in the pancakes , but a syrup mixture .
ladies were smoking outside . they had to enter the store after me . anyways i had a bday coupon which was only redeemable printed . a bit disappointed especially in our generation of high technology and environmental issues .
i went to see him last year for my annual and he seemed very nice . personable . the wait was long but not like most . this year however i found out i was expecting .
they have horrible service i got in a wreck since december 2015 and i 've had a hard time trying to ahold on donna my case manager and she takes weeks to answer a call .
food is average , price is over the roof ! you can find way better places than this , and pay a lot better food for $ 70 for less than 10 tiny plates . this place suck ! and will charge you extra plates that you did'nt even get.
the name of the place changed so i think it must be under new ownership . i ordered the crab wontons and instead received an appetizer that looked like mozzarella sticks but had some type of meat inside that i think is fish .
so i was here by myself . while everyone around me got complimentary chips and guacamole i got none . the food was so small in portion and tasted awful . def wo n't come back .
young man came out and seemed very nice and honorable so i agreed to have them come take care of the problem in the guest bedroom . i was given a guarantee that if i ever have problems they would be right out .
after waiting 25 minutes in line and watching over 10 people turn away , the final arrival to the counter to see the food or lack there of was not only a let down but disgusting .
stayed at the tahiti village hotel and ate lunch here once . no more . the hotel advertises this place as a restaurant and bar . it 's really a bar that just happens to serve food . mediocre food that is . served very slowly .
i got a set of acrylic nails here and after a day and a half , all of them are lifting . i mean all 10 , every single one .
this location tends to have problems with the food . a lot of times i will have to wait for a new batch of food to be made because what they have kept under the heat lamps for who knows how long needs to be replaced .
wo n't allow service animals , they are afraid a small service pug would gross out other customers i even offered to sit in the quite corner of restraunt if it helped the situation .
will never call to order for delivery again at this restaurant . from the moment i called until i received it toke 1 hour and a 45 min ! ca n't believe it until it really happen .
boring , boring , boring . compared to the other bars we went to , this was drab with a small crowd . they probably have their regulars but i would n't be one of them . the bathroom was very cramped and smelled awful .
that big guy working inside should be fired , was super rude when i asked for something then ripped the plastic off and was super disrespectful to my wife saying you people etc , do not recommend this place at all
do n't order the turkey burger ! mine was smaller than advertised , machine processed rather than hand for , med and tasteless .
we had several issues when this guy was called . he fixed 2 of them awesomely . one big issue was the open signal allowing a neighbor to control the door . we made several calls to have him fix and he never called back .
had a poopy experience and poop cafe . they took our down down , yet let 3 groups ahead of us who came after . sat down and there was no server for a long time . best part , is we came for the hk waffle .
i do n't know how this is still open - we were excited a st louis was opening in the beach . it has to be the worst food we 've ever had . the fries were never fully cooked , i think a batch was still a potato ?
the only thing this place has is free wifi . the food prices are horrible ! baggage is slow . slot machines take up much seating . kiosk salesman soliciting passengers .
we ordered 550 booklets with time sensitive information from this printer . the self proclaimed king of sales '' , terrell , helped us with our order . he made sure to collect payment from us before doing anything .
this is the first review i 've ever written and i feel i have to . this was a massive ripoff !
worst gas station ever . the pumps are always broken ! the pumps machines always have graffiti all over the screens , and are so slow ! the store itself is disgustingly dirty .
we had a bad experience here about five days ago . three of us had a gel manicure at the same time and one of us had to wait an entire hour to be seated to even begin .
short fat waitress with long dark hair working on 2 20 14 at 9pm hour ripped off my friends and me for $ 25 . we paid our bill of $ 60 in cash plus $ 5 tip and handed it to her folded in the receipt .
i ordered over the phone for delivery and it was literally , the worst . i love chinese . it takes a lot for it to be taste bad to me . but this was almost inedible . the rice looked like potatoes it was so overlooked .
this place is crap . thats just flat out the truth . how do you mess up tempura sauce ? the food isnt fresh and im surprised this pos isnt closed yet . im hoping i dont get sick .
really was n't impressed with our dynamic earth . i went with two boys aged 6 and 7 . their favourite part ? climbing on the big rock sculptures on the lawn outside !
this place is super pretentious and unaccommodating . the staff are rude . not only that i found a long brown hair in my brownie . there are several other cafes there can make a far superior americanos or lattes .
i alway have problems here . i came in the store today with my 20 year old pregnant wife . we were just finding some lemon poppyseed muffins for her and we passed the liquor aisle and i wanted some beer .
horrible experience on our last visit ! we went there on a saturday evening and checked in for three haircuts . this was around 5:10 pm . there were two ladies without their name badge on . both had poor customer service skills but one of them was worse !
dont even bother with them . they 'll just arrive 20-30 minutes late and then call you back in rage that you took another taxi . very poor , horrible service , taxi drivers and pricing .
worst japanese restaurant ever ! chicken teriyaki came out raw ! gross and then the manager comes out and says all chicken should be pink or red because we use young chickens ! attitude very poor ! i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone , food was awful !
probably the slowest service you will ever get . super long lines . lines because it was vegas but it takes them almost 5 mins to make one drink . no smiles . all they did was kept talking to each other . can you hurry up please ?
service here is horrible . you walk up to the counter and they stare at you with attitude , waiting for your order . no hi what can i get you ? '' , can i help you '' etc . not even a hello .
in the last month i 've had 2 packages sent to me . one took 2 weeks to get and when checking the tracking number said it was out for delivery for a whole week .
poor cleanliness . of the three breakfast places on this block , this one is my least favourite for both value and food .
waste of time ! -- - went in to view town homes in this complex since my husband and i are always on the lookout for great homes for our expanding family .
i only go to this place for brunch or lunch to have their fantastic cuban sandwiches . their service is so consistently poor though . it should not take you over an hour to order and eat what is essentially a grilled cheese and fries .
do not use ! more like ghetto car rental . took over two hours to get a rental they only had two people working on a friday night . ridiculous . would never use this company again
do n't expect good customer service here ! one girl to gift wrap on valentine 's day the gentleman in front of me left upset after waiting and no one had wrapped his item yet .
it 's a shame to have such a culture rich city and yet there are not that great of hispanic places that really hit the spot . my bf and i came in here to get elote . and it was less than appetizing .
poor customer service and unreliable . came in for an oil change and they directed me to come back another day so they can clean even though they are open for 4 more hours .
we were waking around the galleria trying to find the bf his shoes . he spotted the shoes he liked on their display tower outside of the store . we walked in to find a salesperson to get his size .
so the place is not that bad but the service is terrible . the lady during the night shift told us we can have late check out and we were happy about that since i just go into town . next morning .
been here twice and both times i left within 5 minutes . girls get free shots for a reason , they would n't get people otherwise ! just do n't go . its a complete waste of time .
moved to madison 2 months ago and we 've been here 3 times . not because of the food , mostly for the lake view . never again . on our last visit , i had to send my trout back . it was bad .
1 star joint . a great place to pass time with friends and family . but food is one star compared to panda express .
horrible ! if you can go to a different pharmacy , do it ! took 3 weeks for to get me my medication ! 3 weeks ! they always say the did n't get a shipment , doctor did n't do it right , etc .
centurylink in an unethical and dishonest business . they lie about their pricing , and refuse to address consumer problems . i am being charged almost 40 month more than i agreed to , and they are simply stating the promotion i got does not exist .
this online bookstore is terrible . i ordered a book from australia and chose to pay 17.5 usd for 5-8 working days shipping instead of 9 usd .
the worst ! everyone there seems to be impolite and actively trying to avoid helping customers . i usually have to stand waiting while they finish their personal conversations before someone will finally ask if i need something .
to fix it '' has lost all credibility ! what a bunch of scam artists . can someone say , huge conflict of interest ? so , they own parker and sons ? check out their ratings on google maps . abysmal !
well . do n't ask for pot stickers when they do n't have any because they will be red about it when you ask .
horrible service . i walked in and waited . the restaurant was n't that busy and i could see there were tables available .
i ca n't believe how disrespectful these people are , my order was placed in early april with eta of 6-8 weeks , i waited for 3 months to contact them but never heard anything back . waited 2 more weeks and try to email call but nothing back .
we 've come here a couple times for a nail trim . we made the trip over and then this time randomly they need verification of rabies . not a problem but a huge waste of our time .
over priced , mediocre food . i had chicken pad thai . there were literally two tiny pieces of chicken in it !
worst customer service i have ever experienced . the guy or owner or whatever he was was in the phone when i walked in for a good 10 minutes . then i asked him for some sizing when another customer came in and he started working with her .
i could have received a better diagnoses from a circus animal . went in for an eye infection and the dr on duty did n't even look at the spot i pointed out !
i would give zero stars if i could . avoid this place . here 's my top reasons why : 1 ) my hot tea was served in a plastic cup twice until i asked them to put it in a mug . 2 ) there is no brisket .
i bought a groupon for this place . total scam . the groupon was $ 10.99 for 2 burgers . however , the groupon does not include toppings ( learn this when the receipt comes to you ) . each burger goes for 6.99 to begin with .
overall the food is amazing and very reasonable price during the lunch time . however , i was very disappoint it at the end . i saw a lady order a drink for to go . she drink it and found out it was wrong order .
let me count the ways why velvet underground has rubbed me wrong . well , for one the first time i went there i lost my keys .
looking for good fish and chips ? keep looking . the fish gets 3 stars , it was edible but certainly not the best , a bit on the greasy side ( and not in a good way ) .
a suburban rental car company with no place to leave one 's personal car during the trip : utterly useless .
rude service . girl at the counter was texting ! rang up my products and tried not to give me a bag . the store barely has any products available .
we ate at the newly opened pho 88 restaurant at s. rainbow . i have to say we are very dissapointed with their food . i ordered beef stew , but it didnt comes with bread which it was supposed to be included .
their website says that the response is guaranteed within 24 hours . i have sent an email last week describing my concern . no reply . later that week i have left a voice mail with my name , number and my inquiry , still nothing 8 days later .
red shoe use to be the place to bring your girl and get so sexy shoes . those days are over . we stopped in at 12:30 on friday . the owner ignored us the sign said open lights were on and the sign said open at 10:30 .
just crappy mexican food the best part was the mexican flag in my food . but this a disgrace to mexico in every way possible . every single menu item taste the same . the salsa is watery and nasty . do n't waste your time .
the first time i went to a planet hollywood restaurant was in san francisco , ca . the service was slow , the food was average , but the price was n't bad .
this has to be the worst place i 've eaten a long long time . the food was at best bland . the service . oh did we have any ? the price $ $ $ $ . never again .
the food was decent , however , the wait for delivery was over an hour and they forgot one of the 2 mains that we ordered .
the food is awful . drinks are weak . service is terrible . sunday brunch is good & there is a bloody mary bar .
first visit to choo choo 's . the review on their website was much more impressive than the actual food . the description of the deluxe hamburger that i ordered was more grand than the burger that was served to me . where 's the beef '' ?
what a horrible horrible business . i bought 2 recliners and a couch from them . the couch is fine however we have had nothing but problems with the recliners .
i love bath and body . whenever i go in i always buy over a $ 100 worth of stuff . i tried this store for the first time and it was horrible . they ignored the shit out of me the entire time .
the food here is not good . it is unbelievable how greasy it is . i had a shawarma sandwich and the grease was just pouring out of it . i also had the potatoes and they were swimming in grease .
after waiting 30 minutes for a glass of water , we had to find another place to eat . the waitress and hostess were rude and unapologetic for their lack of attention . the food looked great but the service is extremely disappointing .
initially wanted to try this place because it looked clean and modern . pricing : cheap for poutines at 5.99 each . service : overheard them saying that the fries take too long to make . it took 10-15 minutes to make though they apologized for the wait .
dear reviewers , do not go here . the ice cream taste funny and if you want a refund they can not issue you one since they use a credit machine . to save all the hassle just avoid it unless you want to take a chance .
two weeks ago i went with my daughter and grandson . the photographer got great shots . we purchased the father 's day package , the disk , and extra sheets with enhancements . photographer had problems with the machine and could not print our photos .
they mess up orders all the time ! especially when going through the drive-thru . i also ordered an egg and cheese sandwich and when i got to work to eat it there was no egg on it . pure laziness at this store .
drive thru is ridiculously slow ! every time ! do n't waste your time . management needs to fix the issue . it should n't take 10 minutes to make 1 smoothie and 1 flat bread each time . absolutely horrible efficiency .
this location is full of young , lazy , rude punks ! seriously , i do n't know how they are in business .
just had the worst experience of my restaurant life . went with a group of 15 . the place was empty . took 20 minutes to get sodas . after an hour and a half wait we left without getting our food . staff was unpleasant to boot .
it 's disappointing that the hair salon uses straight bleach for coloring hair instead of adding color . the woman who did my hair was kind , but truly did an outdated job of adding highlights .
worst service i 've ever had at a starbucks . there were 2 other people in the store and 3 people working . they forgot to make the drink . was told , oh , i thought you were just sitting there , '' by a barista .
my experience is far too long to write on here . i would never recommend anyone give their time , money or service to this place . i have been lied to and taken advantage of on more than one occasion .
two hot girls walk up to the front door after a group of guys walk in . the doorman says , do you have a table ? '' fuck you . it 's a w in scottsdale , az . are you serious ?
denise , your form letter does not fit the situation . i never set foot on the property but every communication and lack of communication just digs you deeper .
i also went there with the $ 29 groupon for deluxe manicure and basic pedicure . they charged me an additional $ 20 for adding gel to my manicure .
some friends and i went here during one of the bike nights . 9 $ special for a burger , beer and fries was a great deal . the burgers were pretty good , nice decent patty size and good amount of toppings .
i have used their services for many years . all my vehicles ride on discount tires . today 's i came for a rotation and it took 2 hours to get it done . they are not the only game in town , i hope they know .
you can sum this place up in two words . no . flavor . the margarita was terrible and tasted like crushed ice . the food had no flavor whatsoever as well . save your money and skip this place .
absolutely horrible ! if it was n't for vincent ( i believe that is what his name was ) i would be contacting ch . 13 on this place . horrible customer service and over priced .
i did n't want to share my experience because they did make it right . but i need to let the public know what happened to me and how aware you should me when it comes to your automobile issues .
although , the ambiance is nice ; i would encourage any large groups to avoid this place .
nothing great about this place . had the salmon teriyaki bento box . the salmon was thin , tasteless and dry . i did n't even finish it because it was legit like a piece of dry and hard sandpaper at the end and i always finish my food .
i am so disappointed in the '' new fresh and easy it is now over priced and missing many of the quick grab something for dinner and an item like band aids or laundry soap i have run out of .
i have never posted a negative review . here goes my first . i am so frustrated with this spa ! beware of the groupon or living social promo 's .
we were there on tuesday 7 5 2016 . the food was horrible and come to find out later they did not even have a cook working that night . the food was old and dried out from reheating .
worst meal ever . we were there over an hour before we got our food and i wish they would have forgotten it altogether .
decided to try something from an upscale location . absolutely disappointed . if you like thin cuts of sashimi and kale that covers half your plate this place is for you ! i apologize for not taking a pictures .
if your getting a perm . spend the extra $ 20 and go some place better . you wo n't regret it .
never written a review on yelp and this is my first . absolutely the worst experience i 've ever had at an auto establishment . i go to the fletchers off lake pleasant and happy valley frequently . this is the first time i 've gone to this fletchers .
i do n't even want to give this place a star. worst customer service ever. the girl at the drive thru was extremely rude. when i pulled up she was shaking her head as if i was bothering her .
stay away ! after 5 visits averaging 30+ minutes waiting for the doctor , i show up 10 minutes late and i am turned away . the dr. was not even professional enough to come out and tell me himself .
waiting over 15 minutes for burgers , some chicken poppers , fries and a shake . once it came , the fries and chicken obviously had been sitting out for awhile . burger was extremely dry and barely above room temperature . near flavorless .
gloves were used yo perform massage , this place is really unprofessional and the quality is questionable . i have never had a massage that involves gloves in my life . enough is said about this place .
do not go to this place ! they are just unsanitary . we found a tissue paper in the rice . i ordered take out and there was a bug in our salad . i would not eat raw food from a place this bad .
okay , i waited too long to order a refill for my 19 year old cat 's pain medication . but , i have learned my lesson .
i purchased a one year old porsche . as a part of the transaction , i traded my mercedes and was told that the car was involved in a recall .
i have been working out at this location for a bout one year . when i first joined lifetime fitness in matthews it was such a great gym and a positive environment . all the staff seem to be happy and very positive .
slow - line up at the cashier and line up to get you coffee . seems a little unorganized and unfortunately not as friendly as other stores - well that 's what to expect at a high frequented store .
this place is fucking terrible . the people running the pharmacy are extremely rude and unwilling to help there favorite line is sorry i cant fill that '' . not only happened to me but with several people i wait for in the slow lines .
terrible terrible customer service ! i work at a well known cosmetics brand so i know exactly what good customer service is and you can not find that here . the staff is standoffish and does n't seem willing to help .
i had a bad experience here . she refused to honor a living social deal . i felt really duped . would n't go back if she paid me ! i attempted to make a reservation 3 weeks before my groupon expired . no-go . and snotty to boot .
i 'm surprised to see all the positive feed back . i had my nails done last week . i swear a 5 year old could have done a better job . they 're lumpy and 5 days later are lifting .
overpriced small no seasoning swimming in water crawfish .
i found a hair in my steak ! honestly that 's disgusting i am never going to spend my whole check on a steak again . the server jonathan is pretty hot though .
bad experience , cold food , brown lettuce , do n't even know how to describe the tomato . do n't expect gourmet but can i get decent ?
ate breakfast at iron rail café this morning . ordered eggs your way '' , scrambled eggs , toast , hash browns & bacon .
everything was okay ( not great tho ) until a server ( an old woman ) told me hey ! you did n't put tip ! where is tip ? ? '' at the door .
pay more somewhere else , do n't bend over again and again i have been with cox for almost 10 years .
everything tastes fake . the tuna is nasty and the other meats are slimy . their lettuce is dry and the restaurant stinks really bad like bo and mayonnaise . i wo n't be back . take your $ $ elsewhere ! fast is not always the best !
serious question , do they ever answer their phone ? read all the reviews on ow the never have hot and ready '' already made , so i tried calling to place an order . called three time in the last 10 minutes and no answer . frustrating .
how does this place get anything about 1 star . im a reasonable guy but when you walk in they do n't even acknowledge you .
very disappointed with my experience at 70 down . we booked dinner for 5 people during winterlicious for my mom 's birthday . our reservation was at 7 but upon arrival we were told that they were still getting our table ready .
i almost never post negative reviews , but this location does not represent auntie anne 's level of quality . the store looked disorganized . the employee who was working the front at the time barely acknowledged me .
if you 're looking for very poor service and over cooked seafood for over $ 40 a person then you 're in the right place ! if not , save your self the trouble and go some where else !
looks like they shut this place down - as i correctly predicted in me review in 2012 . well deserved . c'est la vie
well look at that . i was right . maybe i missed the length of time a little bit but in the end i was right . at the risk of sounding smug , yeah i knew it , predicted it and i was right . again .
after wading through clouds of cigarette smoke from their cooks drivers standing out front and waiting for 15 minutes in the tacky dining room for my order that i called in an hour beforehand , finally got our pizza .
i had been to this place twice and both times were horrible experiences . i first went to retouch my roots ( bleach ) and then to bleach a section of hair .
overpriced . tiny portions . total waste of $ $ $ $ $ $ $ service was good but the quality of food was low and priced like a 5star restaurant . i ordered their foie gras which i love love love and what i got was pate !
went in today to get a pedicure . very unhappy with it . i got the pedicure plus , so i paid extra to have a nicer pedicure . however she did a horrible paint job .
i have been using rinse and ride since it opened and have always been satisfied . march 6th my opinion changed . i took my 2008 infiniti through like i have a million times .
i went here while on vacation visiting my friend . neither of us had been there before , but i know they have lots of locations on the west coast , so we gave it a try . the staff was totally rude .
customer service is awful . called because room next to mine had their music blaring at 4am ( was n't even good music ) and it took 30 minutes for someone to actually come up and have them turn it down .
seemed fine until a friend was asked to leave this establishment without a refund . the reason given was that her makeup rubbed off on the towels and the door was slammed . now , i used to work as a professional ballroom dancer .
the greasiest shit hole . go for pizza instead or walk up the street . the food here must not be sanitary because it gave me food poisoning . sick for days after eating here , avoid at all costs , save yourselves .
i 've never used this guy but he advertises by leaving his flyers on cars . very annoying . for the person claiming 1 agent in the world '' you 'd think he would n't need to advertise this way .
the new return policy is stupid . they get the order wrong often , and i say nothing . but this new policy is just stupid .
had the chocolate covered banana . it tasted as though it was frozen days ago and was nearly impossible to eat . wish i would have spent the $ 4 toward a fresh caramel apple . the ice cream is nothing exciting , just blue bunny .
in my last 2 visits with my 2 vehicles i have found that the oil section is made of individuals who are not full mechanics and like to make false claims to get more money . case in point .
i had been visiting phoenix for the holidays when my dog woke up with a terrible eye infection . i called north central animal hospital that was recommended by a family friend but they were booked with only urgent care '' appointments available for an extra fee .
98 of the seats and armrest in the imax theater are torn . paying this much money for a horrible comfort i 'm not satisfied .
horrible place to do business . if you value your safety or your vehicle i say go somewhere that appreciates your business . not going to write a book about my experience but the manager here has no control over the quality of the service .
golf course is nice but incredibly poor management . marty was by far the most rude and uneducated course marshall i have ever seen in 20 years of golf .
the worst groomers i 've ever been to , and i 've had dog 's for 20+ years . do not go . they 're lazy and over priced .
i ordered a gourmet spinach chicken goat cheese pizza . i picked it up and found there was barely any sauce and cheese and there was one piece of chicken and one sun-dried tomato on each slice ! ( did n't check it before paying ) .
i ate there last night with my parents . their food has gone downhill . they use to cut thier own fries . .not anymore . everything we ordered was frozen 5 minutes prior . you can get the same quality meal by simply going in your freezer .
i sent my phone here a month ago for repair . from day one , i have been calling to find out if my phone ever even made it to the location .
waited in the drive thru for an eternity . literally waited 25 mins . i ordered the special chicken sandwich they were featuring , some type of chipotle chicken sandwich .
these people are friendly enough and i 'm sure they 'd be happy to sell or rent you something , but when you need to drop of a uhaul trailer they do n't want , they simply wo n't take it .
it 's just horrible pizza . must be a tax write off or something . sorry but it 's just not very good .
you would think steak queen would make good steak right ? wrong ! we ordered steak , medium well , and we got a fast fry think piece of overcooked beef . it definitely was a fail ! even the gravy that came on the fries , tasted odd .
i almost feel bad giving ethan allen a single star but it is well deserved . the furniture is super nice no doubt but for the money and the customer service no way .
the food was okay , not the best i 've had & not the worst . i wo n't be coming here again tho i do n't like that they charge a gratuity on to the bill and a $ 6 one at that .
the worst place on earth . lines are ridiculous no matter what time you arrive , customer service is deplorable and there are never enough parking spaces .
walked in . had several drinks . after 1 hour and a half a guy came up and said you did n't pay cover , $ 10 or get out . no one there when i walked in . totally humiliated and embarassed at the asshole treatment .
so far everyone that ordered before us has gone up and complain after the people have asked for their money back . got to love the restaurant business
went here every 2 weeks , for set fill & pedi , for 2 months .
all i will say is that you can tell by the photos that this place is not well known for its food .
came in here for the buy one take one deal.
terrible . waited 30 minutes to order . an hour for a food . then they double charged everyone , said tip was included but charged everyone wrong . and the food was n't worth it . do n't go here , especially with a big party .
if you 're expecting this would be close to or at least similar to chow king or food from home ( philippines ) , it 's not . very disappointing . it was a waste of time , money and effort
i 'm giving this place 1 star because the cooks are great but unfortunately the cashiers have the crappiest customer service . when i ordered my pizza this morning she had me repeat it 5 times so i would think she would know what i paid for.
abe 's is closed . drove across town only to discover construction crews tearing out all the equipment .
i wish i had gotten the chance to try their food . my husband and i went to the restaurant at 12:30pm this afternoon for lunch . the cafe still had their open light on but their doors were locked .
very bad ! it 's not the real chinese cuisine . just garbage food . i order a sweet sour shrimp it was like four fried flour ball with tiny shrimp . and the sauce was too much artificial red color and sugar .
i would not recommend this place to anyone . i went there looking for a gift . i received no help . the girl was too busy helping the wives of the baseball players . i guess you need a large bank account to receive help in this store .
i went in on wed for a shirt to be altered for an important work event . i told her i needed it by sat . i went today and alteration wasnt done .
called for a simple large pizza for drive-thru pickup tonight . get to window , pay , wait , then am told they need 8 more minutes since they burned my pizza . wo n't go back .
i used to work here at this location and let me tell you . aside from being dirty and gross , everyone is in the worst mood all the time and the general manager sucks . at least the one who was there when i was did .
service sucks , let me tell you why . i am vegan . i asked for a foot long with my bread toasted . the guy at the counter asked whether or not i wanted meat or cheese , i said no .
words fail to describe how terribly rude and arrogant the staff everywhere for this airline is - check-in agents , counter agents , baggage help , all of them seem to have received training in upping one another on how to deliver bad service .
this is the worst burger king i been to ! they served old overcooked french fries and the fish burger was old , lettuce old ! yuk !
scheduled an appointment . based on grill size i was quoted a price of $ 150.00 . appointment time arrives but no bar-b-que . unable to reach anyone and was unable to leave a message as mailbox was full .
checked into the monte carlo tonight , i have n't been this disappointed in a long time . we are suppose to stay here for 3 night 's , but we will be checking out tomorrow .
this company completely ripped us off . we paid over 600.00 for a limo ride to a club , and for tickets to a snoop dogg show , that was supposed to provide us with vip access .
i waited like 20 minutes for a big mac meal ! i thought its supposed to be fast food a perfect place to go when you need a quick lunch from work . customers after me were getting there meals before me .
horrible customer service . i 've gone in twice now and i wo n't ever go back again .
hated it the stupid bitch and her manager did n't know shit did n't take my mother fuckin discount in drive thru never go here they 're all dumb rats
i 've been going to kohler academy ( now penrose academy ) for 7 months and i 've slowly started dislike their ability to cut my hair . at first , it was great .
went back and tried again . mistake . what they call a buffet is a joke . two half eaten pizzas and about 3 pieces of garlic bread . the pizza was hot and very cheesey which s good , but otherwise nothing worth mentioning .
i usually do n't enjoy giving places 1 star , but this has been the worst cupcake experience yet . my sister and i went to try these cupcakes . she had a red velvet cupcake , and i had a carrot cake cupcake .
i purchased a groupon for an oil change . called to make an appointment . was told : they do n't really make appointments . you have to call in the morning and they 'll let you know if maybe i can fit you in later '' really ?
if i could score lower i would , just called to place an order and they said they were closed , even they close at 9pm . its 8:15pm . first time to try them , last time too .
poor customer service . i called to place an order using a mailer coupon for buy one get one free pizza . i was told i had to dine in to use the coupon .
bed bugs , killed a bug on the couch and it sprayed blood , was n't sure if it was a bed bug or not . went to the front desk and told them .
ordered a sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle , got mcgriddle bread . no sausage . no egg . no cheese . are you freaking kidding me ? i 've had some bad experiences with mcdonald 's , but this is definitely a first .
sadly after 3 visits the service is not better . today we timed 42 minutes to get our drinks from the bar . our food came out and we asked for silverware and waited 11 minutes with our food getting colder and being attacked by flies before our silverware .
so disappointing - asked the hostess how long the wait would be on a clearly busy night . was told no more than 30 minutes and that they would call when the table was ready . went for a coffee nearby and gave up after an hour .
i wish i cold give no stars but i had a horrible experience do not recommend going to this arby 's ever , the service and food quality is become nasty !
i called this establishment to get a price on getting my front windshield replaced . guy picks up the phone and tells me to relax and stop screaming . wtf is is wrong with this guy ! then tells me go find someone else .
when you receive the email , after you pay , it says to call and confirm your hotel . do call , because in my case , the customer service rep said they did n't know if they would be picking up at the hotel .
by far the worst tim horton 's in town ! bad service , poor quality and they seem to never have anything . today they served me a burnt sandwich , it 's literally half black and smells burnt .
convenient location but the employees of this branch are a joke . i do n't think anyone actually knows what is going on . multiple times i have waited over an hour when the store is almost empty . the staff is rude , short and condescending .
this is the second time i have come to this location and they 've messed up my order . i did n't check both bags until i got home and they forgot my nuggets !
most of the toppings are out of a can , and the cheese is flavorless and very low quality . please get a real fresh pizza pie elsewhere . would never return or recommend .
do not go here and make an appointment . it is absolutely ridiculous . my appointment in september took 2 hours ! i only wanted to clean my teeth and then polish ! all i got was floss ! they did n't even clean or polish my teeth .
this is probably the worst drive thru place i 've been to in my life . i went there 6 times and they never got my order right . they were always rude to me as well .
its been more than an hour after given order . still no food . very poor service . not even ask for water . food was just ok .
unfortunately i did n't get to try the food . first thing that was said to me when i walked in was , sorry it 's going to be at least an hour we have 4 online orders '' i get it but i do n't .
we really like the other location in chandler , but this location in gilbert was a huge disappointment . the food is just not right - felt nauseous after . i heard similar results from others who went on different occasions .
the worst dunkin donuts i 've ever been to . they 're so unfriendly and out of the handful of times i 've visited , i do n't think they 've ever gotten my order correct . like not even close honestly .
service here is awful ! waitress brought out our food and check and never bothered checking on us again . good luck getting a refill .
simply put , not the best indian food in town ( or not even good ) . went here because a close friend who used to live in the area recommended it . drove 20 minutes to get a take out for two and the food was very disappointing .
had dinner this evening . my server was pleasant and tried to fix bad cooking . i got chicken parmesan with penne . very little cheese on meat . extra cheese sent in a cup , grated ! wow ! and it was cold !
scum . slowest service i 've ever had . took me an hour to get a terrible sandwich . cashier was so rude , acting like i 'm the reason he 's working fast food .
everything we got was burnt and took over 15 min to get ( we were the only ones in the drive thru )
attended a wedding at seville golf and country club . the doubletree provided a shuttle to the event and also scheduled a pickup immediately following the event . on our way the driver did n't provide professional customer service ( did n't help us out of the van ) .
insipid food . pathetic selection . rundown and outdated decor in desperate need of a remodel . and 40 bucks for this ! wake up mgm
my boyfriend and i came to this location because it was advertised as wheelchair accessible which it most certainly is not . there were several steps down to the entrance itself which could n't even be cleared if the wheelchair was manual and there was someone to assist .
i 've eaten here three times . 1 there were 3 tables of people . my pizza took 45 minutes and was served burned to a crisp . 2 there were 4 or 5 tables and the service was almost as slow as the firs time .
went in for a haircut with kathy . she is a master stylist . did not listen to me when i told her what i wanted . i asked her to follow what i had . .long soft layers and a touch of face framing .
i 'll start with the positive . they have some friendly members of staff . that 's it . you might catch a staff infection here , so watch out . it 's like a shack that somehow got a bar licence .
my husband always uses this store . yesterday he took our new dodge ram in for new tires , there was absolutely nothing wrong with our truck . paid $ 700.00 for new tires , he took the truck home where he realized it had been damaged .
i will never go back there again , they only had one lady doing nails she was working on five people all at one time she cut my fingers in three different places we were there a total of two hours just to get nails and a pedicure
i got pick up the other week and arrived when they said it would be ready . it was n't ready yet had to wait like 5-10 min which is n't a big deal . the pizza however was horrible it looked like someone poured extra grease on it .
i 'm so annoyed right now because i 'm pretty sure i got old ass fucking pizza with some overly salted wings . definitely not worth $ 45 .
i would not trust them when they tell you you need work done . get a second opinion . went there for an oil change and was told i needed a new water pump at the tune of 650 .
what has happened to this location ? awkward feeling while eating . the manager or assistant manager shouting across the restaurant to the young cashier to clean up the bathroom and not the dishes or the dining room . i stared at her and she seemed to whisper instead .
the worst run , slowest einstein location in the u.s . you would be better served leaving the airport to drive to a location in town ; and you would have your bagel faster . over 20 minute avg wait after order
currently staying here , we 've been here for 4 nights and have had to go down to get new key cards 3 times because the ones they give us stop working .
horrible ! they have no idea what customer service is . i went in and asked for a fill and more white for my french manicure . they cut my nails as requested but did n't add more white .
the owner was completely inconsiderate and rude . i 'm visiting from out of town ( washington dc ) and will not be back . i 'll be sure to tell all of my family and friends in the area to not come to this place .
i love paramount but not this location . to start , the customer service is poor . they took my order only after the server had to make it known to her counterpart about the latest snap chat conversation . the bread was made fresh but was undercooked .
ugly dusty musty crusty place i will never go to ever again but she did my eyebrows good tho but still
usually shop here but was not impressed today with the store . their chip reader is not working . so i loaded my food onto the belt .
really poor experience -- though our server was great the kitchen is clearly a mess .
i bought a cheesecake from this place yesterday and . that was the worst cheesecake i have ever eaten in my life . i had a regular cheesecake and my bf and i did n't finish it we just had a bite each .
the website does n't say you need to reserve . never thought you can reserve cheese cake or you had to . drove from downtown only to be told you ca n't get anything if you do n't have it reserved .
against my better judgement i ordered a large pepperoni pizza from this place . it was a big mistake . the pepperoni tasted like it was old expired . it was the most disgusting pizza i 've ever eaten . i 'm surprised they are still in business .
this place used to be another bbq house restuarant which i did n't like , expensive for the food you get and taste was so so. not the best . so now , it 's still a bbq place but under different name , kb smokehouse .
i used to like this place but this morning not only were they not open like the hrs state on the door but the 1st employee was 15 min late and the next employee 20 .
why do the steaks at this place look like they were sliced up at a lumber mill ?
i came in looking for a particular product and could not see 5 feet in front of me when i came through the door .
sandwich was good but it was small and nothing i could n't make at home in 3 minutes . they need to sell other types of food
first time visiting , and the experience was horrible . my son & i each had an entree and a soda . service was extremely slow . when the waiter brought over the bill , it was over $ 50 !
service is slow as hell . food is over priced . 8 staff members two doing nothing . ( the one in laval )
there are some things that do n't translate well , there has to be something in the water , or in the scenery or something in the air . this papaya king was rotten .
get it together . how the hell are you gon na have only 1 person on duty . there 's a line of 5 people with only one person working . literally waited 15 minutes to get my sandwich started . terrible service .
waited nearly two hours for food . ca n't comment on the food because we left before we were served . will not be back .
changed atm . it used to make you pull your card and beep at you before you could print a receipt . now it beeps at you to print receipt and then pull card with no sound . why fix stuff that is n't broken ?
luckily i had cash on me since that 's all they were accepting . ordered then was told they only have original . huh ? i do n't get why if you are running low on chicken would n't you start making more before a customer orders .
i stopped in with some friends today . we have been trying all the restaurants in the regent square area and , sadly , i have to say that ease is my least favorite so far .
another fail at the lake ! 5 star pricing with 2 star food and 2 star staff ! i left starving and disappointed !
food was n't that great . staff are very rude and not respectful of their business . wo n't be going back .
this magazine is a disgrace -- there is no way to get in touch with anyone -- try calling the number listed ! owner is a liar and the people who work there protect him .
beware ladies ! k gouges you on price and even after 6 months , my brows are not right . i called her after less than 6 months for 1 area that needed to be filled in and it would cost $ 100 for a touch up .
friendly staff but incredibly slow . i , unfortunately , am forced to rent from this location almost every week for business and receive terribly slow customer service every time , despite numerous employees walking around .
the owner of this shop is anything but spiritual , she 's very nasty and judgemental . she hires anyone to be a reader and really has no clue what spirituality is . this shop is all about the money and nothing else .
one word describes this location : slow ! i really like white castle , and i know that the food is made fresh and takes longer than most fast food restaurants , but 25 minutes in a drive through with no one in front of you . really ?
this might be one of the worst kfc locations in all of the phoenix area . tables are absolutely filthy . floor is disgusting . the employees '' walk around aimlessly and with seemingly no direction while customers wait 15+ minutes for simple orders .
one of , if not the worst contractor i have ever used . don and jim were very nice upfront but once they get paid , they go mia . i did a patio , fence and landscaping with them .
stay far away from this place . this practice is only concerned about money . read the bad reviews . they are spot on !
i ordered a medium , was charged for a large and got a small . conveniently , the clerk told me in a hurry , you dont want your receipt do you ? ''
sub par food . terrible service . the food has been slipping in quality steadily for well over a year -- to a point that it 's on par with super market take-out . the service has also become deplorable .
most unprofessional place i 've ever ordered from . there was a hair put in the cut of an 11 '' sandwich so when i told them about this they cancel my order .
went here last night to get some sweets . peanut butter cookie was stale and bland . it seemed to be overloaded with sugar and was extremely dry . i also got a dark chocolate caramel and milk chocolate caramel ( 3 each ) .
this place is horribly slow ! waited for about 20 minutes for a small order . the employees are loud and unprofessional .
had a missed connection via air canada and they put us up here for the night until the next flight in the morning .
that celebrity chef , claudio , unbelievable in comparison to what we view on television . i had to get up and leave with my sons seeing the behaviour he displayed by the patio bar . yelling at his employees in front of customers .
the worst thing about thus airport is that they allow the worlds worst airline , united , to fly out of there . if they would dump united , i would give them 5 stars .
ca n't really comment because i came on normal business hours and at normal time at 4pm and they were closed no sign no nothing . kinda disappointing .
horrible rip off do n't go the machines rob your money . the vacuums do n't have power and are not maintained . do n't go here and less you want to throw away your money . i wasted dollars never going back
1 star , no one in line when we got here . 15 minutes later i asked how much longer ? i was told it had not been started . 2 sandwiches is all we ordered . unfortunately we will return .
i made an appointment to have my kids ' pictures done today , got there and its packed with people , super noisey and even though we got there 10 minutes before our appt . we sat for another 20 min before they called us .
tried to get me to pay for unnecessary repairs and then tried to charge me double what others in the area quoted me . the mechanic i did use did a great job and was very honest .
if you care about your dog . then do n't bring them here ! we had the same experience that other yelpers complained about . our dog was left in a cage all day !
not a fan !
groupon buyers beware of small print on your coupon 's . they will charge you ohio state tax on the actual full salon price of whatever salon services you have purchased .
overpriced visit . rooms were mediocre . why should i have to book a two night minimum when i only need and want to stay one night . seems silly .
so i made an appointment with mandy to do my pedicure . i arrived 3 minutes late , they let me sit there enough time to read an article in a paper . by the time mandy came out its already been 10 minutes later .
hired then to install a home water filtration system . it was one of the worst experiences i 've had with a contractor . they were unprofessional , they over charged us for labor and the plumber was rude . steer clear !
normally , i dont give out a review like this . ordered two xl pizzas . one had a pretty big clump of black hair in it . now i order my food through grubhub . look it up . .great folks there .
had the gyro and shawarma - very sauce was very salty ! the shawarma steak was chew and also very salty ! very disappointed . maybe a visit to east coast west coast might help improve the recipe for the gyros and shawarma .
the sauce here was tasty but the owner -- mario -- did not honor a living social voucher that we had . he did not offer any explanation . he just blew us off as if to say , hey !
used to be a decent barber shop once upon a time . remember kenny used to work here , he was a great barber and a real cool guy . toby could be rude some times .
do n't buy from them they wo n't stop harassing you after you 've done business . they call several times a month and are rude on the phone . you can ask to have them take you off the list but it wo n't happen .
garbage service . will never come back here again . funny how females get 5 star service but guys receive the worst . all i took away besides my juice ( which was too strong harsh ) was that this place is run by douche bags . thx guys !
tried to find this place for halloween supplies . it 's closed !
do not take your children to this location . i left my kids in kids care , and returned an hour later to the lady screaming at them . ( they just turned 2 and 4 ) .
super disappointed in the service today . they had a sale buy 3 get 3 free . i had six items and i asked a sales gal if the items i had qualified for the 3 for 3 .
when ordering a shrimp burrito be aware the cheese comes with it and is not supposed to be charged as extra . i know this because the nellis and stewart location goes by the book on their ingredients .
went there sunday 1am for dancing ( bar hopping ) . the place was not busy at all . the staff was not pleasant . they charge cover charges . the place was dirty . floor was sticky . young small crowd .
horrible service and even worse food . so excited to leave and never come back that i could n't even complain . entrees were inedible . buyer beware . stay away .
i love chinese new year . i was expecting a huge celebration with lots if dumplings and rice cake , but that 's not what i got . the cultural events were also small and not what i 'd expect from such a huge celebration .
this place is a joke ! they are constantly out of everything . on various visits , they have been out of straws , cups and soy .
i 've taken both my sons here- one is 5 and the other is 2 . this morning i had a 9:00 appointment .
let 's see . it took 10 minutes before someone took our drink order . then , for some reason , you are forced to wait for a basket of cheap dry muffins , before they will take your order .
ok , so i was n't going to go into this place since i was getting lunch somewhere else , but i decided to go after i ate . now i love red velvet cupcakes but these cupcakes are crap .
if i could give negative stars i would . all food was burnt beyond recognition and not consumable at all .
a terrible representation and an insult to italian cuisine ! how dare your establishment the name of italian food . disappointing taste and flavor , you can easily identify microwave in use . never again .
horrible ! the place is crap . antiquated machines crowded together . and do not give them any credit card information . in addition to the $ 10 a month , they charged me $ 49 to maintain the $ 10 per month . what ?
the manager here by the name of david needs to get fired asap . worst customer service ever . he actually refused to give me and my girl ice waters in 110 degrees and we were with a kid .
i like the prices , but am not too impressed with the quality of the products . i bought curtains and bed in a bag . i had to return the curtains because of a hole in the thermal lining .
chicken adobo is a sad , sad , sad excuse for the dish . after 6 of us tried it and repulsed in disappointment , i handed it back to the truck and did n't even ask for a refund .
one star is a gift . this company manages our hoa in north scottsdale , and they 're horrible .
just called to get a quote for rabies shot and was interested in this veterinarian for my animals since we 're new to the area . i was informed that this practice for the last 10 years has n't been accepting new patients . wow .
do n't come here for breakfast . you 'll wait 20-30 minutes for your food and the food has no flavor , specifically the hash browns . they are soggy and taste like just an uncooked potato . denny 's has better hash browns .
terrible customer service . they miss price items and do not honor the items displayed value . i came to the store today to buy a pair of shoes .
you just sold me a used usb interface after i specifically asked if its new . what is wrong with you ?
decent sushi and decent prices but horrible service . the waiter was nice but the manager needs to work on her own service skills . we waited an hour for our rolls , and they gave us the wrong rolls twice .
this is not a pet friendly community . if your dog or cat gets out and lost , you are sol because this complex will immediately tear down any lost signs you put up .
i 've been frequenting this place for the past few months . their work is decent , nothing spectacular . the location is convenient for me . although after today , i will never return . i made an appointment with tracy 3 weeks ago for 4:00 today .
their drive thru service at night is horrible . the lady was being rude to us and gave us hard chicken nuggets that were like rocks . i 'm never going back to that place .
the outside of the apartment is nice , the office is nice but the complex has a roach problem . have n't been here 3 months and i 'm having a serious issue with roaches .
i love coming here because it 's near my house but this place should be call snowbird mart ! driving around here is dangerous to your health !
if you sign up for this tv service , make sure you ask specifically if they run a hard or soft credit inquiry , that way you can dispute it if they tell you a soft and run a hard .
do not use this website . i spent $ 2500 for tickets to an nfl game on this website . they were not listed as indoor seats but when they arrived they said indoors on the tickets and i found they were , in fact , inside .
this is the worst hotel in las vegas . there 's nothing in the room . their service is awful . none of those staff we talked to are helpful . the room is for 4 people , but they put service for 1 person .
one star because the appetizers ( spring rolls , thai and viet ) were tasty and the food came out quickly . the other four stars are missing because : water did n't come to our table , it had to be requested both initially and to be refilled .
my husband and i just moved to the area and we 're trying to find a decent delivery place .
only reason i went to this location is because its close to me . i heard its not their best location and looks like it really is n't . the massage was just ok. definitely not 60 or even 50 minutes and maybe i could have a better therapist .
this was a terrible experience from beginning g to end . we waited forever for a waitress when there were only three other tables filled . then we discussed the menu and chose a 2 for $ 20 plus one free appetizer order .
the bartender tonight is lousy ! i 've put $ 60 in the machine and have n't been comped one drink . not even a draft beer . he has changed his name on the specials board twice . now it says erik 2 . he should be fired .
so much for our flight appointment time . we 've been standing in line , to what feels like no end in sight , for the past 40 minutes . it 's extremely hot and frustrating .
wish i would 've seen reviews . service here sucks , it never fails !
so the sign says new name same owners . my opinion it should be new owners . i stopped in because it was near my office and i was craving a sub .
horrible customer service with incredibly smug and condescending salespeople , especially brian s. i highly recommend going elsewhere . edit : now their employee , brian s. , continually sends me harassing emails .
bar is worked by rude entitled middle aged white women who are extremely lazy . they get annoyed when you ask them to do their job . no wonder it 's the only empty restaurant in the airport
my experience here was not good my family and i were seated all the way in the back of the resturant near an exit after passing at least six tables upfront .
i stopped here recently on route to toronto island to grab a few snacks and things , however , i was very disappointed in the amount of food that was expired !
customer service is awful . called to place an order and was asked to wait 2 mins which led to the person hanging up . called right after and they did n't answer . called for a 3rd time only to be asked to hold again for 5 mins .
they do n't let you use your coupon on more than one yard of fabric ! which is just stupid , jo-ann fabric will let you . then they say you ca n't return cut fabric , even though that 's not on their return policy !
i had high hopes for this place but man was i let down ! went there with a groupon for carryout yesterday and got a pizza and wings . figured that would be a good way to judge it .
overpriced ! this place looks good inside and we were very optimistic when we got there . the menu was confusing and the explanation from the server was poor .
only one person at work . waited for a very very long time just for a drink . ( at least 30 min ) .
the pharmacy is horrible even when the lines are small still a long waiting time bad customer service but the store is nice and big . the parking is terrible the isles are small always bumping into people .
i want to start off with . what a rip off . i walk in saying i need just a polish change for both my hands and feet . she says ok . i saw the price said 8 and up . i said i wanted gel nails .
for the price and alleged reputation of this restaurant , i would have expected much , much better food . the steak i had was pretty mediocre and the portions were not particularly generous . i have had much better food in far less expensive restaurants and pubs .
when i walked in , a pnc rep told me to sit in a chair and wait in line . then more people came in after me . after 35 minutes of waiting , i asked the rep how much longer i needed to wait .
this place is a joke . they do nothing that you ask for and then give you attitude when you want it fixed . kim is the worst , her attitude alone has deterred me from ever going back there again !
horrifying service . i was there about 2:45 this afternoon . i had one prepaid package to drop off , but wanted a receipt .
rami and christopher are absolutely terrible at customer service . walked away with a phone that was being shipper to her . i would never come back to this place nor will i use sprint once the contract is done .
pizza was ok. big combo was horrible ; it was extremely greasy and overcooked . the mozzarella sticks did n't even have cheese in them .
28 mins to get served at lunchtime is unacceptable . that 's great that they have soup available but maybe that should have been a red flag .
i did n't like it . the gyros were dry and lacked flavor , same with the rice and potatoes that came with it . the tzatziki sauce seemed too chunky , almost like cream cheese .
just do n't go here . as someone previously said it 's way overpriced . the food is just as shitty as the price .
my family and i decided to take a day trip to charlotte and met my brother for a nice sunday lunch . we arrived and ordered our food , everything was great until my brother looked at the container his fries came in .
we had an explorer . it was a vehicle we enjoyed . so when we heard that the escape hybrid was coming out we stopped by to get some information , they had none .
i was not impressed by their service at all . the box they sent was delivered on time but was not fresh . the salad was limp and zucchini was already mushy .
if there were 0 stars , that would be my pick . the worst ever . they charged me for parts not needed , and could n't even find the issue . they said , and charged me for oem parts , and they were not !
place is a joke . the one chiropractor ( mr. know it all ) made my back worse ! margaret c always has a meeting and is never really there after they sucker you in .
this place sucks . twice now i 've gone . the first time they put onions in my pad thai . who the hell does that ? does n't say it has onions on the menu . so whatever , i 'm over it .
the website is a joke . try to schedule service or contact on line .
the customer service was very bad went in today and they made me wait so long at the drive thru and when they finally talked through it there was no apology for the huge wait
was going to try them for the first time . found about 8 to 10 people waiting for food , three ppl a head of me with one cashier , no time to wait , guess i 'll try again some other time , not impressed at this time .
this is the worst dd ever ! i 'm fairly certain you have to be a miserable human being in order to get hired at this location .
i live in summerlin and was craving checkers so i drove all the way to this location at 2:30 am tonight .
stop to get donut and coffee . had a very limited selection on donuts and coffee was burnt . last time i stop at this one .
this place is the total opposite of urgent care . i was here for 2 hours before i saw a physician . 1 hour in the waiting room and another in the private room .
if i could give this place a 0 i would. we have had countless problems with this location . we got a free pizza through the app and when my bf went to pick it up they tried to make him pay for it .
food poisoning . yes , we are sure .
second time having mean bao and it was such a disappointment . i was expecting soft and fluffy bao but instead i got cold hard ones . it was around 6pm so i guess they didnt want to do more prep work .
i personally hate wasting my time . was recommended this company to use for a major irrigation issue i have right now . after waiting a while to call when i noticed water building under my walkway , i finally decided to make a call last week .
the manager , teresa , was horribly mean to one of her workers . it was during lunch rush and nobody was out helping the young girl worker take orders or get food , and the other guy there was being rude to her .
never coming back ! serviced was not good , there was a bug in my drink and the cashier said something in her native language when my boyfriend and i walked away ( my guess about the tip amount because we were not pleased with anything ) .
so , i am looking for a dry cleaner and i call this place and ask the lady , can you please send me an email with your pricing . she says she is new and can not help but the owner can .
so sick of the front desk staff here . i 've had my appointment rescheduled 3 out of the last 5 times . two of those times i was not even notified , and took time off work to go there .
have n't been there for years . had a steak sub yesterday and was very disappointed . the steak was just like a steak um . i could have made that at home .
horrible company ! they should not be trusted . they take weeks to fix issues . they also just cut down trees with out working out a solution . find a different company that you can trust .
i went there 4 times and only one time i feel i got a massage . about the tips - need to be ready to tip 40 and more no matter you like it or not . ) :
all las vegas locations with the exception of excalibur up and closed a few weeks ago with no notice to employees , etc . my understanding is that most employees were owed several weeks worth of pay .
took my wife for birthday dinner and was very disappointed . steaks had no flavor , we 're only warm and took 30 minutes . the lobster mac and cheese was equally not impressive . this is a morton 's want to be and not even coming close .
i wish i could give a 1 2 star . her carelessness caused my loved one a lot of emotional pain . my loved one said she pretended that she did n't see anything wrong after the surgery .
the service here was horrid the person before us got there food first and the excuse they used was we did n't order anything we ordered from the drive thru and waited
went here back in february and have been meaning to write a review because i 've been fuming about how bad the burrito was ever since . it was the worst burrito i have ever had in my life .
no star - horrible experience . i went there for brunch lunch and manager has no flexibility as to an expired groupon i had and said i had to come back for dinner . no i 'm never going back .
the wings are cooked in microwave taste like crap . and was told even tho i did n't eat them that i would have to pay for them or wait an hour till there was a manager on site . poor poor customer service .
bought the groupon , left 5 voicemails , never received a return phone call . had to eventually call groupon and get a refund . terrible !
very misleading ! the website states that a mani pedi is only $ 31 , i got in and requested that but by the end they charged me $ 60 .
worst biryani in phoenix . hugely disappointed with the taste and choice of rice and meat for making biryani . it 's not fair to call it biryani at all .
guy was very rude on the phone when trying to hold a table for 10min with a newborn . told me to go elsewhere so we did !
worst place ever . end of story . while the apartment is n't bad the office staff is .
how or where should i start ? , well my friends and i was there on sunday evening . we was a party of six and i understand every restaurants do get busy but it was n't too busy .
horrible customer service . i have to wait 40 min . to return a charger that does n't work .
stale cookies .
if you plan on shopping here , just make sure you check the dates on everything ! this store is notorious for selling expired food ! it 's consistent ! i 've complained in the past & simply stopped shopping there .
if i could , i would give it less than a star . let me first start off by saying that i know spirit is known for the cheap flights , and not so much its accommodations . but damn !
you never get your order made correct when you order online . i dont know how they seem to manage to mess up ever order we get but we wont be getting food from them anymore . waste of money and time .
the manager at this location pretty much called me a liar today ! brought something back , she looked at the item and said how do i know this is the item your brining back ! wth ?
gross ! went tonight and made the mistake of ordering a ribeye steak . my meal came with a steak knife with the blade tucked under my steak . when i grabbed the knife , i felt something hard and crusty on the handle .
very bad service and food was n't much better . came in and the restaurant was n't busy . we told the server that the kids were super hungry and yet it still took over an hour to get our meals .
horrible experience . pre-booked a special occasion reservation for a large party . we waited an hour for bread and 30 minutes for water . our food was cold and many of our guest waited 2 hours or more before food came out .
replace the manager with one that knows how to deal with people ( after overcharging them and being rude about it ? ) and you have a restaurant with 3.5 stars .
pool service sucked . pool technician ( ? ? ) spent 15-20 min once a week . the filters had not been cleaned in a year , pool was dirty after 15-20 min job . last time he serviced ( ? ? )
i 'm usually quite happy with this applebee 's but today was a complete different story . i 've been going to this applebee 's for years , today i wanted to go and enjoy a dinner but what i got was n't what i expected it to be .
these employees are the most rude and unprofessional people i 've dealt with in a long time . i was greeted with a scowl , and felt like i was am inconvenience to them .
came in and sat at the counter hoping for a nice quick breakfast . after 45 minutes we still had no food and the place was less than half full . even after the food came it was missing parts .
cheap prices , crappy food . do n't waste your money on this . if you want good food , go to the ali baba on lawrence . no connection to this .
the absolute worst experience i have ever had staying at a hotel . it would 've been better sleeping the night in my car . this was a last minute booming with a late check in because everything else was sold out .
i am still so mad about how i was treated by dr. fulton 's wife receptionist that it took me a year to write a review . i had 4 appointments at $ 50 each to get vein surgery .
received some coupons for this place and thought i would give it a try .
want peppers on your burrito ? sorry , we are out of those and you have to wait 3 minutes . want lemon for your water ? sorry we are out of those . need a knife ? none in sight . this place is a customer service disaster .
i frequent el burrito because i love the food they serve , however , after time after time of horrible service i refuse to go back .
probably the worst place in town to get a massage when i got there the sign said 50 $ for a half hr i have her 60 $ said that she did n't have change wanted a tip up front .
buyer beware , worst return policy ever . even with a receipt , they will not give you store credit after 30 days . terrible customer service !
first of all our cab driver was driving 20-30 km h over speed limit throughout the entire ride ! almost ran into a car cause of it and kept swearing when getting passed off at drivers that were 'in his way ' .
came here looking for a couple of house plants as well as a couple of plants for my balcony . had a list of potential things but i do n't have a green thumb and know little to nothing about plants .
excited to go to this store because it is similar to lush . went to the store last saturday around 4 pm with my husband .
if you want overpriced kitchen stuff and service with a surly attitude , this should be your williams sonoma location to visit . do yourself and your debit card a favor and shop around . you 'll be glad that you did .
disgusting . i wanted to see what the hype was all about . should of not wasted my time . first of all , parking for us vegas peeps is not convenient . it 's actually in the best western .
i am so done with this car wash ! the employees just do not care . i paid for an ultimate wash which cost me around $ 30 .
update : last week i emailed the company and asked for a refund . i did n't get any message back but i did get a shipment confirmation on my first order . 8 months later .
i have to agree with some of the reviews here and say the place would serve itself well and rethink the image they would like representing the restaurant . the service is below average and the staff look and act like it 's a hang out .
one of the worst if not the worst food experience of my life . should have guessed this since even my ice tea tasted funky like the ice tea maker had never been cleaned . order a basic bacon cheese burger and garlic fries .
came here on a saturday at lunch time , expecting it to be pretty busy with the church crowd . to our pleasant surprise it was not too busy .
dirty . dirty . dirty . discarded papers , cigarette butts ( who is smoking at a gas station ? ) , discarded gatorade containers , discarded food , and so much garbage in the cans they are overflowing .
i was n't familiar with firebirds , but gave it a try since so many alternatives were closed after seeing a late movie . i decided upon the 9 oz .
- eat somewhere else . anywhere else . - shawarma should n't taste that bad . notice how you dont see ethnic ppl eat here . very telling sign .
this is the absolute worse place ive ever been to .
we were seated immediately upon entering and it was not too busy for a saturday evening . the server gave our table one menu to look at when we had a party of three which was odd .
god awful ! we called wednesday before our move on saturday to arrange the moving of my mom 's hospital bed in sync with the non-emergency ambulance .
do n't rent from dakota mark taylor co . the pool and the area around it are dirty , bathrooms next to pool are rarely clean cross your fingers when requesting maintenance , 50 50 chance it will be fixed on first visit .
the drink , salad and bread were ok . the prime rib was horrible . a seasoned coating was impossible to get a knife through , as if it were a plastic coating around the beef . the meat was flavorless and the baked potato was forgettable .
total rubbish , i visited this place because i had a decent experience once at their old location and i frequent the franchise in singapore .
booked with this place while going to a concert , and was very disappointed with how things were organized . i was told i would n't be charged for the room until arrival , but instead i was charged two months in advance .
they do not honor their gift certificates . they will happily sell them to you but if you try to redeem one they will not honor them when you try to use them .
this lounge has a weird policy that if you order a hookah , you need to order a drink as well . they also dont provide refill of coals . the hookah is really expensive ( 12 $ ) , since they do n't provide any refills .
i usually eat here every wednesday night when im in town . ( every wednesday ) the last two weeks i was not able to do so because no one would answer the phone .
i ca n't believe we drove all the way for this ! this place is awful ! they barely have any furniture , and the little that they have is really poor quality . the finishing on the wood peels right off and bubbles up easily .
this has bee the worst experience of my life !
getting one star because i have to . after i paid a month in advance , and my current month is paid , when i advised that i was cancelling my insurance , they said that they are going to charge me $ 89.00 to cancel my insurance .
terrible customer service misleading about charges . charged my card with out authorization . a complete rip off , do not use their services .
that 's the worst car wash in town . after paying 40 $ , i had to go home and clean again my car , remove winter stains from carpet , polish windows , etc .
one star because you ca n't get any lower . they are always slow and 9 times out of 10 their ice cream machine is broken . you get stuck in line just trying to get a cone when ever other mcdonald 's has one that works .
called order in . the gentleman who answered was very pleasant . however the delivery driver was extremely rude . before handing over our food , she wanted her tip first . she had no problem asking for it as if it was owed .
juste pas bon . je vous conseille amir , c'est meilleur . le service n'est même pas bon . et je ne parle pas du prix .
dropped by tonight with my boyfriend 4 19 16 to try out their acai primo bowl because we had a gift card . i 've never been a big fan of jamba juice but the bowls did look really good . unfortunately , they tasted really bad .
they informed me i checked in too late so they charged me an extra night in addition to my initial one night stay . then when try to contact the front desk i only received a busy signal though i tried multiple times
wanted to try some local chinese food used my grub hub account . we ordered chow mien and the noodles came out brunt i call to let them know and the girl who answered said well that 's how we make it here '' well ok then thanks .
the most unprofessional company i 've ever encountered . stay away at all costs !
my gf and myself just had lunch here and paid $ 25.00 for a chicken shawarma and a chicken shawarma plate . the pita bread was brought without any condiments or dipping sauce . the shawarma was small , bland and without much flavour at all .
who wants a watered down drink ? unfortunately this starbucks is very inconsistent with their drinks and their customer service . sometimes i get a good drink with a friendly barista but most times i 'm served a unhappy drink from an unhappy barista .
their customer service is the worst . i literally had to beg for help in the flooring department . do n't waste your time there , go somewhere else .
hi everybody , i have been with my wife ( we are from oregon ) at this location for dinner a week ago , omg what a horrible experience we had !
horrible customer service . employees ignored my request to pull and return my items and before looking for my items said they were probably stolen . the consignment manager said to go home and she would call me if they found it .
i went to the restaurant for the first time . i got the number 1 combo which was two pieces of fish , a piece of chicken and three shrimp . my sides were rice and green beans .
i could write a book on this place . the care tends to take a turn if it 's not an emergency .
the single worst experience i have ever had at a cleaners . while a cleaner can not get out every stain , my clothes were actually dirty after i brought them there . the owner was the rudest shop owner i have ever met .
was a bit over priced for the food . friendly environment , but ca n't justify the price for hispanic food . food quality was alright , a bit bland . the yelp check was n't valid , did not honour their own deals .
i would n't even give this place a single star , if i could . we went there at 7:45pm , pulled up and were asked to be patient as it would be a minute .
i did n't like it and even my husband he tried the chicken and i tried the chicken sandwich . i do n't know how does it get this high rank ?
very clean . the staff is n't very friendly or helpful though . my nail tech actually stopped to chat on her cell phone at one point which i found to be quite rude . i got a full set of pink and whites .
this place was nasty dirty ; machines filthy . my last time coming here
chicken thigh with spicy garlic sauce tasted very bland . very little sauce and could n't taste the garlic . combo ramen soup lol . i 'm trying not to be mean here but plain old boiling water has more flavor .
so far , a very unprofessional experience . the treatment coordinator did not return any of my phone calls or faxes so that i could provide secondary insurance information for my stepdaughter 's treatment .
at noon on saturday , it was partially full but not packed . the menu looked innovative and promising but the restaurant did n't deliver . all the tables were dirty , and it was easy to see why .
i live nearby and have eaten here with mixed results . quite frankly there are just too many better alternatives nearby to settle for average ( at best ) . there is also a communication barrier to deal with and i 'm not real comfortable with their sanitary rating .
this place sucks ! i 've never had worse service and product anywhere ! do yourself a favor and do n't waste your time !
do n't even want to give them that one star . i 've been going there since 11 years . today is the last day i 'll ever step foot in there again . terrible service .
not happy at all . was extremely disappointed . requested no onions on pizza , got onions . the bbq hamburger pizza was too watery . pizza not even cut !
hotel was pretty over priced for everything it consisted of . purchased the deluxe queen and upgraded for 60 bucks for a better view . view was okay . moths filled our room and it was very disturbing .
very rude and they do n't have any fish . my 5 year old just wanted a tuna roll . they only have salmon and could not make a salmon roll . again very rude when i requested a basic roll .
i came to this branch on a saturday to cash a check . the teller told me they had run out of cash . seriously . seriously . seriously ! i thought she was joking , one star for this being totally ridiculous & hilarious .
when in to get a pedicure , they had me sitting there with foil on my toes to take the gel polish off for 30 minutes and totally ignored . i did n't even get a chance to relax or soak my feet in the water .
if you know what you need and do n't expect any expertise or service then by all means go for it .
ate here three times and it was great . fourth time i noticed the cook had very long fingernails . he was just chopping and flipping the food on the fry plate with those long fingernails . no gloves .
terrible service , here , my son is no longer a patient here , the service is terrible , the only good thing i can say is the male receptionist is nice , but for as the doctor and her assistance 4 thumbs down .
can you say horrible . the restaurant was under staffed it seemed and the old blonde waitress barely gave us the time of day . she even did not notice the fly in the water that she brought .
i understand up selling but give me a break . i felt like a basic car wash was turning into a confrontation . the part that pissed me off is he must have mention scratches 5 times , waxing buffing etc .
damn it ! i really wanted to like this place . located next to one of my favorite breakfast joints it 's old school vegas and eccentric as hell . i needed a watch battery replaced , i drove across the valley to frank 's to get it done .
sandwiches were not good bland no flavor meat was cheap pasta salad macaroni and potatoes salad sucked too chocolate chip cookie was bad too !
second attempt at this restaurant and same poor service . staff was very slow to even recognize we were waiting at the hostess stand . finally a server noticed and we were seated .
i will never step foot in this establishment again !
horrible service , they messed up my order , and the meat was dried out . very overpriced . i will never go back to this place .
olive garden has gone downhill . this nellis blvd . location had all the wrong stuff . we entered and had a 10 minute wait so went to the bar . the bartender was short with us and did n't care .
quality is poor at best and definitely not worth the money . do n't come here expecting anything close to what you 're hoping for . we waited forever for food they did n't even need to cook .
amazingly rude staff ! 0 patience ! i wanted to switch to verizon but staff was horrible !
well what can i say . the owners are very nice and try . i think the wife should do more then seat people . she could pass food around while the husband cooks diff meats .
we hired united car service for my daughter and her friends for homecoming . it was just one problem after another . we paid up front but the driver insisted we had n't paid . after a few phone calls , the office never ran our credit card .
went to this place today to dry a couple of loads of clothes , been here several times before when someone walks up to me and says , it 's $ 3.00 extra to dry your clothes here if you do not wash them here first . ''
food quality is about average , nothing too special . the shawarma was just okay . they got my order wrong and the manager tried to argue with me about whether i could order take out or not with a groupon .
this store used to be a treasure mine . it 's been under new ownership and it has changed a lot and not for the better . most items do n't have prices on them . the ones that do are way overpriced junk .
online says tires in stock . made appointment and confirmed . drop of car and again confirms car make and model . two hours later get call that tires are not stock . thanks for wasting my time !
ca n't believe i ate this food ! i should 've just got my donut and left ! hash browns were burnt and the breakfast sandwich was horrible ! plus the waiting , ca n't be in a hurry here ! they should stick to donuts !
used to be good . ordered take out ( 5 dishes ) for 6 ppl ( made rice at home ) for $ 48 .
where 's the beef ? not in my sandwich . i ordered the mini cheesesteak . .but this is ridiculous . my iced tea was $ 5 . this mall food court is pretty slim pickings , but skip this place !
holy grossness . i guess i should n't be so harsh about this place but the vegas strip is the land of food and i really think the competition is tight . if i had to wear high heels and fake eyelashes .
horrible i will never go back ! i orders a number 4 , looks good in picture , but the burger was horrible i even had to go ask for more onion strings because there were only 3 on my burger .
this place used to be so friendly and had great service . came for brunch on super bowl sunday to angry bartenders , shitty manager , and the worst service i 've had in cleveland .
never ever ever again . inedible . i was ravenous when i ordered and it arrived more than an hour later . i was n't going to be picky . but : my food arrived cold . and nothing is truly tasty .
we have been to chung moi a few times and i have to agree , the food is pretty good and the portions are really big . but the restaurant is in a sketchy area and the interiors are beyond deplorable , dark and dingy .
aside from the quaint brown paper on cardboard packaging i just ca n't get into bland sauce on cardboard equivalent crust . i 've had better factory pizza at $ 6 for a large around the block .
the worst customer service ever . i got my lashes done and 2 days later they began to come off and when i went back to get them fixed instead of correcting immediately the lady had the nerve to tell me it would be an hour wait .
i was looking for a new primary care and was recommended to him . i had brought all my history expecting him to review it . he told me he did n't have the time to do that nor interest .
worst place ever . they over charge . all the staff are impolite and disrespectful . do not ever go here they will rip you off
i received a mani & pedi here . mani came out alright but pedi was terrible from the beginning of the process . my toes were tender from being filed so much in attempt to correct the shape !
the umbrella broke after three uses . low quality . owner offered a discounted cost plus i pay for shipping to replace it . he was very rude .
the doctor prescribed me medication that i am allergic to . it was in my chart and i told her about my allergy in person . i ended up in the emergency room .
joe , my waiter was super nice and attentive to everyone ! realize that this is airport food , but i , like many others , expect more from david burke .
what the fuck . i ordered a california burrito and i got a cold ass tortilla with only beef in it .
worst bank i have ever been too . super slow . only a few bankers and to many tellers . if you are in a hurry do n't waist your time and go here .
unacceptable service and poor quality . ordered a custom table and after six months still waiting for my table to be completed .
wow did n't know it was possible to screw up an order so bad . i was in a rush and grabbed my to go order quickly and left without double checking my order was correct .
poor service . extremely high prices ! insane pricing yet on yelp they say $ $ price range moderate . '' yea right . let me say it 's most definitely $ $ $ $ price range very high .
this place has the worst and most expensive shish kabob i have ever eaten in my life . the meat tasted so bad and it was almost raw that i could n't swallow it .
they got ta do better . with everything . service . food . prices . the games . literally half the game do n't work . the staff fixing them tells me he does n't know when it 's gon na be fixed .
did n't like food and terrible service , food took forever and was cold and dry looking when it finally arrived . view was great , too bad dining experience was n't up to its surroundings .
i have been getting my nails done for over 10 years , and it 's very rare i have to fight with anyone about what i want . i do pink and white , and get them short .
we purchased a 2016 dodge ram from here that buying experience was great .
i got food poisoning on sat from the red dragon roll . please someone send a health and safety inspector to this place : (
office and staff are less than professional and have no respect for your time . i went 2 times and both were nightmares . i was never given option to see another dr or pa for my results . this office seems to only cater to pregnant women .
dirty store to match the parking lot . smells like sewage by the self check outs and staff is quick to run and hide before helping .
chubby lady was really rude in the drive-thru when i came back when they missed my order and did n't give me my frosty . she pretty much shoved the frosty onto my hand and had that fuck off '' look and attitude .
because the gas is shell , they put a $ 75 hold on gas transactions . inside was typical with sticky counters by the fountains and hot dogs that have been on the grill too long .
what a bunch of crooks ! took our rv in for services use to make sure everything was running right , was there for weeks !
do n't go here ! bouncers with egos who like to kick patrons out for no reason ! what a joke .
absolutely the worst experience i 've ever had getting glasses . screwed up my contacts . told me to wait for the eye doc and then was told i was done . all i have been doing is going back and forth .
horrible placed an order said they could n't find the address then said they were at the address knocking and ringing the doorbell none of which was true .
um . .well . my feet stuck to the floor . smoking is allowed . do i have to go on ? okay , maybe the only redeeming quality is that the dj was decent . oh and the ultra cool third floor . looks like someone 's attic .
it 's hard to screw up breakfast . but they sure did it . scrambled eggs were ok. hash browns were mush . bacon was burnt on half of the slice and undercooked on the other half . i do n't even know how that can happen .
never had checkers before so i decided to try it out . the employee was nice but the food sucked . costco has better hotdogs , no joke .
please do n't let this new place fool you , it 's very nice but that 's where it stops . the owners are horrible and the directors are not any better .
omg . just came from dinner . never again . ran out of tap beer , and brought us a half a glass . no veal , even though we called yesterday and asked about their veal .
horrible customer service , came from another auto zone because they were supposed to have the part we needed , even called in advance to have them double check and they had the wrong part in the box so we had go to a different one .
got the 2 shawarma special and still ended up getting charged almost $ 10 . i regretted the decision as soon as i got in the car and took a small bite out of it .
for a restaurant where the entree prices start at $ 30 you would think the food would be better . appetizers were ok ( calamari ) but my main course was not worth the $ 45 price tag .
if it were possible to give this place 1 8 of a star i would . quite possibly the worst burrito food slop on a plate that i have ever consumed in my life .
have been leaving message for a month now , trying to get an appointment at one of their offices . i keep being told that the person who answers the phone ca n't make appointments , and being transferred to a voicemail box .
first time ordering anything and i went with the vegetable pad thai . vibrant red noodles that tasted only of chinese sweet and sour sauce . served with lemon ? minimal peanuts ? no thanks . wo n't be returning .
if you are thinking of dropping off your items at this store do n't do it ! i had placed the same items on craigslist for seven pieces four of which were hand carved mango wood pieces .
poor service from the cashier and the manager . they ran out of ice . i already paid for my meal and wanted to get ice with my drink . the manager said they would not fill up the ice because they were too busy .
my husband and i were getting tired of pizza so we chose to order chinese . china inn is close so we decided to try it .
travel forever for what a waste of time . food was average new chef needs training . good luck to this place ! do n't waste your time and gas . try the boulders it 's closer ! service was the worst diner service .
one star is me being generous after my experience here one sunday watching football .
went in today not realizing that they had changed name and owners . new name is happy wok . ordered won ton soup and all it was was broth , house fried rice and the house chow fun and no flavor .
i just walked out after waiting upfront for 5 minutes with no one coming upfront to serve me . the girls were giggling in the back and even walked towards the soda machine to try and get in their line if site .
a friend and i came here for dinner . the place was packed . this increased our expectations . the food was overall awful . we ordered the chicken kabob and the mixed grill kabob . the food came with salad and lentil soup .
have been coming here because the only place i knew of that offered a no frills '' express pedicure at affordable price . had to ask the nail technician to get new , sterilized tools . yup . my last visit here - will not return .
yes i come to happy foods to order $ 50 worth of food and i asked for sweet and sour sauce . so she tells me that does n't come with your order it 's $ 0.50 extra .
terrible customer service ! the chubby white guy with glasses at the counter saw us walking up , and i could tell by his facial expressions he was irritated . i guess they were closing soon .
we stayed here because we read hemingway stayed here ( about 90 years ago ) . it was not so great then and it 's worse now . there was n't much sound insulation to the next room and the room itself is not so great .
do n't have insurance ? do n't have $ 150 up front ? sorry ! they ca n't see you ! no option to bill . pretty awful rule . did n't realize an urgent care could turn someone away like that .
horrible customer service . they have cover charges that they do n't tell you about . the hookah quality is bad . i am always disappointed here , and will never go back .
they sold me a bench on 2 21 16 . they filed for bankruptcy a week later . no notification . no refund . no bench . no ethics . no class . nothing short of theft ; they took my money with no intention of delivering a product .
i made an appointment for friday afternoon and forgot that i had an appointment . the owner of the salon called me to rant about how i wasted her time and she could 've made money off of other clients . well it happens .
i usually bring a few of my friends here every week . me being a local from las vegas on a wednesday they denied me . i was pretty disappointed and the manager '' who walked me out would n't give me his name .
maybe i came on the wrong day because my barber 's name was richard and i was very unhappy . i could have probably gotten a better fade if i had done it myself .
their name is almost right . terrible car wash , or we will mess up your car or something along those line . just a tip that suit better for this business
never seen a worse food store like this . i felt really really unwelcome when coming in and store staff never step aside even i said excuse me '' twice .
most mediocre sub i 've ever eaten . limited options for toppings . much prefer subway where you can ask for whatever topping you like as you go through the line . i went back with my sandwich to ask if they had salt and pepper .
i 've called three times and no one answers the phone , no one responds to my vm . i own a business , i have five stars on yelp and it all starts with picking up the phone and these people ca n't even do that .
there was no wait , but when i walked in to talk to the receptionist , she would n't get off a personal phone call to answer my question , just told me to fill out a form .
when you ask for no sauce and to put it on the side that means no sauce and on the side . its really annoying and ruins your evening when you have to ring out your gyro before you eat it .
$ 30 for two people to eat in n out '' quality burgers in a chipotle '' atmosphere . rip off . save your money
this place is not only the worst thai place ever but the most expensive plate that i have ever paid for . fist of all the chief was not a person from thailand the place was far from ethnic thai .
update : they did the exact same thing to my wife on her latest visit . they charged our insurance to repair their own shoddy work . one of her fillings fell out and they charged us to repair it ! avoid these scammers !
waste of time and money . inexperienced slow staff and overpriced mediocre food . it must be this new location because the matthews one is just fine . save your wallet and time by choosing from the nearby jimmy johns or jersey mikes .
i should have been smart and read reviews first . my wife went first and they wanted to so a $ 400 special cleaning and replace 2 of her crowns that never gave her any issues . their 1 million x-rays revealed that her crowns were n't perfect .
went there for lunch around 1:15 , not expecting it to take 25 minutes for a salad . sadly , this place is under staffed and lacking everything needed to be a good lunch spot . i do n't recommend it .
bad service got my lunch for free soup was cold waited 20 mins for a turkey sandwhich .
one person working and 7 cars waiting . not only am i handicap waiting 20 minutes but i am going to miss my flight . according to the worker , who is taking his sweet time per car there is only one worker on sunday 's .
the main reason that this place is a shithole is simple : it is university of michigan fans ' bar . it smells like ass and stale cigarettes , walmart employees ' body odors , and whores .
of all the starbucks in the c-u area , this location is the absolute worst . they are always slow as hell ! you go there on any day of the week , whether morning , afternoon , or evening , you always wait at least 10 minutes .
false advertising re their easy returns '' policy - they do not care about customer retention i purchased an electronics item which has a 180 day return policy on their website .
this place is terrible ! the waiting time is ridiculous . my initial visit was 2 hours with a $ 50 fee . for what ? just a few simple vital signs that i could have taken myself .
this fucking place es close when it said it was open fix your stupid shit .
i 've given this nail salon a multiple chances . the first few times i came , my nails were great . but as i became a frequent customer , i began to feel i was being taken advantage of .
would 've been ok but our waitress decided to ignore us . talked to a manager twice , then found the waitress who said just give me a minute ( after waiting about 25 minutes for the beer i ordered ) .
if there was an option for zero stars that 's my choice . they did not abide by the signed agreement between buyer and seller . when they released money without agreement and did shoddy work they were discovered .
they got my order wrong and i told them and said i was a liar and refused to help me . it was the worst customer service i have seen in awhile .
i get an hour for lunch , i do n't understand why it takes my whole lunch break to order and receive my food .
such a bad attitude and appeared unwelcoming of foreign people . slammed drinks on the bar and laughed when i asked if she sold cider . she then asked for id from all our group with ages of 22 upto 34 .
i called to schedule an appointment . the receptionist was rude and refused to assist me with healthcare insurance . she told me call back when you have it figured out .
worst taco bell ever . it took us 30 mins to get our food , inexperienced workers , food was not very good . i would drive out of my way not to go to this taco bell . seriously awful .
since new management they have horrible customer service ! there 's this girl always at the desk ( ashley ) she 's the worst !
they diagnosed our non starting vehicle as fuel issues and the cost depending on what repair would be anywhere from $ 3k for fuel pump to 10k with all injectors repaired . we decided to get a 2nd opinion . turns out it was electrical related not fuel .
not coming here anymore . the guys working here are so sketchy not because the way they look , but because every time i come here they always find a tiny chip in my windshield and want to fix it ( at a cost of course ) .
dined here in january and not worth the effort . terrible service , way overpriced for just a notch above taco bell ! do n't waste your time until management gets their head .
took 2 hours to come via uber eats , which is unacceptable . things were okay until i bit into a vile disgusting long hair just two bites into my roti . i will never order from this disgusting restaurant again .
you know , this town is hard to do business in . to be successful you have to really focus on the quality of the food and top notch service ! this place has missed the mark on both these items for me in two separate visits !
i do n't know why i continue to come here . they always take 30 mins longer than the time is quoted online .
misleading . please be sure to look over your bill before paying if you paid in advance . they will charge you for insurance and gas option and be very sneaky about it .
pretty terrible experience overall . just went for my birthday dinner and was so excited to have a steak . server carried my beverages to the table under his arm rather than using a tray . lemons were slimy that were served for my water and iced tea .
so wish i could give a nail fat zero ! nails all slant to the right and my cuticles are bleeding . to top it off when you get a fill she does not put a clear coat on top ! stay away .
we came in , waited over an hour at the table no bread , no food . we did get salad . must have been 80 degrees in there manager claims one hour earlier it was freezing .
f this place ! took my dog here to board and they told me she had an accident '' and they would n't tell me what it was . my dog came back looking very shook and her skin felt weird .
always a long line despite many available registers . poor management wasting everyone 's time .
i was just harassed by the sales man at the paris hotel . he dragged me into the store and kept pressuring me to buy his product just like someone trying to sell a time share .
if i could give this pharmacy a zero i would they are so rude , ignorant and do not know how to do their job . i was forced to come here because they were the only ones with the medicine my husband needed after having heart surgery .
i have found this to be the worst starbucks around . they are consistently slow and constantly get orders wrong . this is not just once or twice but has happened at least 6-7 times in the past year .
i worked here for a good three months let me say , it 's always dirty in the back staff does n't care about the food our quality . that 's the reason i left . the workers where do mean to me i went home crying most nights .
worst experience ever . first they wiped the top of my shake with there hands then when i asked to remake it they used the same cup . then said they were lucky they did n't wipe there mouth on it .
personally i had a great burger , unfortunately my boyfriend had a much worse experience . he got his burger '' and received lettuce in a bun with no hamburger patty . it was pretty funny to me , but he 's still mad .
service was poor , food was mediocre , and my wife and i were both violently ill the next day . steer clear
i 've been here twice . my first experience was pleasant . the second time , the lady could n't even file my nails straight .
big smoke alright ! nothing special just expensive , better off going to mcds , burger king . def more affordable & decent selection . highly not recommended .
expensive compared to the other vietnamese restaurant nearby . the grill pork was salty , the rice was hard ro chew , undercooked . not coming back .
i wish i could give them a zero star . booked spirit by accident on expedia . worst airline experience ever . the staff is rude and they have so many fees and charges . such a hassle . this airline should not be in the market .
very rude staff , the place is half empty and they turn away a party of 6 . the people managing this restaurant are amateurs . not recommended , too many other options around uptown charlotte .
my only interaction with this cvs location is over the phone to fill a prescription . i am currently traveling and was unable to pick up a prescription before it was auto refilled .
one thing it has is a view of the mountain everything else is a disaster the worst service i 've had in my life
i was excited that this opened near my work , only to be greatly disappointed . i have given this location 3 chances . first time i sat in drive thru , and sat , and sat .
please go when it is $ 2.00 days , that is about what it is worth . make sure you eat ahead of time . very limited food venders , and no variety . i will say last year was much different , and a lot of fun
my friend and i ordered take-out from this place this afternoon . i can honestly say that it was one of the most dissatisfying meals i have ever eaten .
wow this company sucks ! they quoted me one price over the phone and then when they got here it was 80 dollars more then i was quoted ! the ad also claims the floor will be dry instantly that is not true !
do not move in here ! i rent from an owner and my unit is fairly nice , but the hoa is a pain , the community ( at least on my side ) is trashy .
my daughter purchased a phone charger at this location . the second time she used it , the charger caught on fire . she no longer had the receipt because she did n't intend to take it back .
i have eaten here once and would never go back . had breakfast . the bacon was greasy , the potatoes were almost raw , and worst of all the coffee was cold would not recommend this restaurant
just left here . we have had to go through this company for 3 years now .
wish i would have read the reviews before choosing this company via groupon . do not use this company , they are rip off artists ! i originally found them on groupon for a $ 50 a c check and tune-up .
too salty . .made my mouth hurt , and my stomach ill . the food sucks .
tried to schedule a quote for our master shower to get redone , but customer service representative refused to waste their designer 's time '' by coming to talk just to me .
disappointing . a friend and i went for dinner the other night . we ordered the shrimp tempura roll , spicy salmon roll and caliente roll ( avocado , jalapeno and fish ) . the rice was chewy and the tempura was stale .
ughh so disappointed usually this place is n't too bad but after yesterday never again . $ 50 of delivery ordered and never to be heard of again .
not impressed . the doctor sends his pa in before the surgery . the doctor does n't come and speak with us before they take him to surgery . this is the docs first surgery of the morning . maybe i just have high expectations .
awful service . would not help me in store so i went to walmart and they put a block on my account so i could n't buy the phone at walmart either . do n't let them know you 're going to walmart to buy the phone !
roaches in the bathroom ! yuck . everyone is super rude , and the entire order was a mess , then when we asked nicely for it to be fixed the guy rolled his eyes .
she is okay with eyebrows . i had my chin and neck done & those areas are not her best . i felt the general pain of threading while i was in the shop but it was not until i was hours away that i felt my chin burning .
the manager forced us to leave the restaurant because we had two animals . we were sitting outside but beyond this , both were service dogs . this manager is appalling and a stain on an otherwise beautiful chagrin falls experience .
this company is horrible . i went to there concord location and their stylist ruined my hair . i cried for days , and when i called the owner adrian and asked to be compensated she refused .
in a word . terrible . just terrible . to be fair , i was not expecting much , but was way worse than i expected . we both ordered burgers . they looked like and tasted like sobeys frozen patties .
mmmm , chocolate milkshake . .i enjoy this chain but will no longer support this location . they have been unresponsive to requests to shovel their sidewalks and create a safety issue . until they are good community members and neighbors , i just wo n't go here anymore .
let me start that customer service sucks . we called ahead and found out that our rv was ready . we get there , sign in and stood there for 2 hours without anybody even acknowledging us .
i tried to use the catering service . they were supposed to e mail me a menu , but they did n't . when i called to try and get it again i was told that they were too busy to help .
the girls were nice enough but paid a lot of attention to the asian idol on tv .
horrible service this last time around . never have had a bad exp here but never again will i come get a haircut . maria i think her name was , did n't speak good english but i showed her a picture of the cut i wanted .
this location is horrible . it 's more expensive then other locations . the manager is rude , and it 's run poorly .
expect to wait at least an hour when you come here . regardless of the day and time . i have been coming here for far too long and every time i tell myself i need to find another place .
the ladies in this shop are rude ! they asked my friend to please put his drink on a counter to the side but then offered no help to us . i really wanted to look at a couple of scarves but no one offered any help .
do n't join this service . and if you decide to use their one on one '' training , think again . it ruined my financially . the contract is extremely one sided and literally destroyed me financially .
first time there and not impressed at all . not incredible . my stomach is paying the price for it now . watch out . service is n't good either .
i ordered online and had to wait 20 minutes for my food to be ready . meanwhile they serve at least 20 other people before starting my order . when they should automatically start your order when your there if its not ready .
poor customer service . does not inspire confidence things will get taken care of . life insurance is serious business , i will be moving my business away from this guy 's office .
i ordered the chicken shawarma with rice and made the mistake of ordering hot sauce and garlic sauce . i noticed right away that my meal tasted weirdly sweet and then noticed that the garlic sauce '' was nothing more than ranch dressing .
we will never ever go to this place ever again . .it 's a rip off . they are false advertising the menu on the wall says one price and when they charge you more money when you go to pick up .
described job to jb , quoted four hours w two people working . they get to our house , work for 45 minutes , then start explaining how they ca n't do this and ca n't do that .
i 'll pass . .not a reliable place . mike should say to my face if he does n't want to service my vehicles .
i went again last week for an appointment and i really do n't think i 'll be returning . again i love carrie she is wonderful but the front desk is annoying .
i ordered 30 wings . they were dry , small , meatless , and not fresh . i thought they were going to be buffalo style , but they come plain with sauce on the side .
had their burger and cajun fries - for what you pay it 's nothing special and the fries was covered in a weird cajun flavored powder .
horrible . felt unwelcome when i walked in as no one greeted me . sam '' was miserable . he was pissed that i did n't know what number '' i use for the clippers . he said i have never heard of someone not knowing their number '' .
the service department here is a joke . i had my vehicle in for a 30,000 mile service and the tech . forgot to refill the coolant reservoir . my engine overheated and smoke poured into the cabin , so i drove back to the dealership .
wish i could tell you . i have tried to email with some service questions . i 've tried to get someone to email me through the live chat on their website and no one has even gotten back to me .
come on now starbucks , get it together . there are 2 bathrooms here , one is full of diarrhea ( fine , some customer was gross , whatever ) so i go in the other one . this sink has not been cleaned in what looks like months .
am i an idiot for thinking an $ 11 wash would actually get my car clean . .guess so . i have been a frequent customer for several years . this place is convenient , and i like ( or i did ) that they hand dried .
after attending the yelp vip experience , tried to go their tonight and was informed it was closed for good . sorry !
very disappointed in the store . many of the unique items are horribly overpriced . these items were given to them and they sit around for many weeks until they discount them to someone else . do n't trust this store !
this was one of the worst experiences in a restaurant i 've ever had . we went for breakfast . after seeing the banner hanging outside in passing a few times , we decided to stop in .
i understand that this place may be very busy , but the fact that i 've called three times and have n't gotten a response is ridiculous . trying somewhere else .
my first time eating here . oh my goodness . why would anyone eat here food is gross . worst chicken ever , it was like rubber .
will not return . $ 33 to shine men 's leather shoes . ( one pair ) . most places it 's $ 15 & they give you a shoe polish to take home . he did n't give me anything ! very disappointing . do not recommend .
wo n't honor coupon : ( even when we had had one for each member of our group grrrr sarah
be very careful then dealing with these folks . while my car was getting some body work done , the insurance company and auto body place set me up with a rental from hertz .
same complaints as everyone else . really disappointed with the amount of time it takes to get any repairs done . we 've had a smoke detector that is impossible to get to without the tallest extension ladder chirping at all hours of the night .
the supposed filled donuts are actually sunken in the middle because there is not enough filling . a smear does not qualify as being a filling . their stock is always missing many if its donuts . the customer service is terrible .
i realize it is an airport restaurant but you do n't yell that your bandaid just got wet and take it off in front of me and then tell your coworker you 're glad the customers are not ordering from here .
i gave them a star simply for the speed of delivery and their so so chicken satay . the rest of the food tasted odd . i had the garlic pepper '' beef , ( there was nothing peppery about it ) , and the combo fried rice .
very unprofessional ! i setup a procedure being fully aware of the deposit and subsequent details regarding rescheduling and such .
update : still , i will never buy from them again . i was asked to contact management . in hopes that i could be helped at all , i did . it has been over a year and i have received no call backs at all .
lobby closes at 10pm , and the drive thru closes at 11pm . arrived at 9:40pm , doors were locked .
rang my doorbell unannounced ( in a gated community ) at 8:00 pm on a monday night , waking up the baby and causing the dogs to go crazy . salesman was rude and confrontational when rejected through the window . similar stories from neighbors in my community .
did n't answer the phone when i called so i placed the order online . they took 30 mins to even put the stuff in the oven . when delivered , the driver made me come outside in the cold to his car .
the food is room temperature . worse the employees do n't wash their hands after using the rest room .
if i could i would honestly give zero stars . .we signed up for our phones being told it was going ot be a flat rate of 145 a month , which is fine . first bill came out to be about 160 and then next one was 180 .
i was going to order a muffin and then i saw that there were fruit flies in the bakery case . that made me want to gag a little . the coffee tastes ok , but the barista was n't very polite .
this place . i would think you 'd get better service in the seventh layer of hell before you get any type of good service from this place . management definitely reflects only employees attitude towards customers and absolutely redefines what service is .
when your server says it 's going to be a long wait because the kitchen is way behind , that for one made me not want to wait .
i ordered take out for the family , and over an hour and 10 minutes later our order is still not ready . i 'm still not sure why it is taking so long on a take out order .
disgusting food , very rude people . unbelievable !
i 've used this firm before and they 've been quite good , but their scheduling and time management has gotten worse and worse .
this place is understaff and needs more seating in the lobby . labcorp in general needs more weekend locations to accommodate the overflow from this location . let 's add unfriendly check in staff to the mix and horrible parking .
i am a regular walgreens user the benefit of the shared computer data makes the medicine pick up easy . this time was not so pleasant .
went here the other night and the store was completly empty and they were closed . there was a sign saying they had gone out of business and the cafe rio next door also said that they were permanently closed .
they cut my dog 's ear badly and charged me full price before they showed me how bad it was . i was told it was a nip at first .
the service packages are extremely overpriced for one thing . but i would n't complain so much if i got my money 's worth in service . took my car for an oil change and they took over two hours .
not feeling this place . two visits because we are a family who loves their chicken but so disappointed with both visits . the price point for what you get along with quality is poor . the chicken was dry and the toast lacks any kind of flavor .
first of all , i am chinese and therefore am naturally more demanding regarding the quality of chinese food . saigon saigon is just poor quality chinese food . the food from the buffet is poor quality . i can not speak to the food from the menu .
very unpleasant experience only talking with the scheduler . rude , not helpful and very unaccomodating . never wan na call her back .
terrible food . it 's dirty and oily . and the speed is so slow . we wait for 1 hour to have the food ready . so hot inside . no air conditioner .
super disappointing ! we ordered a bunch of food pho , egg rolls , mongolian chicken , pad thai and i will never ever eat here again .
i ordered there chicken parmesan pizza and ordered garlic sauce on the side instead of giving it to me on the side they put it all over . the pizza was disgusting and made me so sick i had pain in my stomach for about 2 days .
arrived 2hrs earlier than anticipated they wanted charge me a whole extra day ! no thanks take my business elsewhere .
service : it 's a one man show . the gentleman serving me was the cashier , cook , and server . ambiance : went during friday night at prime dinner time and the shop was empty . this already tells you a lot .
gosh , having been here about 6 times since it opened seems like it keeps getting worse . had a terrible meal the other night , took an hour to get our guacamole . looked understaffed , lots of tables with empty plates stacked on them .
i thought i would try to spare others , seeing as how yelp is how i found this chiropractor : i came here after years of chronic back pain while i was in between jobs .
poor service from an unfriendly counter girl . limited choices at 9am . donuts are not that good , tasted stale
terrible just terrible . rude . condescending . not knowledgeable about current offer and phones . just walked out on them when they told me to do my own research . go to the one actually owned by t-mobile .
the worst location i have seen ! 16 people standing in line , two oblivious associates with attitudes that wont answer questions or care .
i brought a pair of mens shoes in to have the soles and heals replaced . the shoes had a one piece rubber sole and heal and left marks on some floors .
not busy trash cans full . wings were small and gross . and the employees were very unprofessional and cussed alot . no respect for customers . we 're out of almost all soda .
ordered take out on a friday night and we were extremely disappointed with the quality of food . the wonton soup broth was basically soy sauce with frozen wontons and a couple veggies .
definitely agree with the horrible customer service comment . especially when it comes to the mortgage department . if u were thinking about using this bank . keep searching .
service : 3 10 the service was extremely slow ( 4 hours from the time we got in to the time we got out . )
i came at 10:50 pm hoping to get a sandwich for the movie theater and they told me that it was closed . sad !
i paid $ 300 for a dye by ruben 's assistant and although it was expensive , i left the salon happy . afterall , the salon had great reviews and i felt i was in good hands .
my wife insisted we stop by for dessert because of the hype after eating across the street at fate . as fate would have it the place was fairly empty so we thought lets give it a shot .
terrible service . very unorganized staff . forgot about our drinks and food . i 'd suggest writing orders down next time , it 's not that hard to do ! it was n't even very busy and the lack of service was terrible .
horrible store assistance . called them to find a product , said they were busy , and try and call back at a later time . when i called again , a few times nobody answered .
disappointing at best . server was good however you could tell they were short staff . 20 minutes to get a salad . fish was cold and not much better than the frozen stuff from giant eagle .
the worst pedicure i 've ever gotten . the place was so filthy . so dirty it made my skin crawl . the girl who did my nails did an awful job . did n't even clean under my nails . gross !
this establishment is definitely not worth your time or your money . the food is terribly inept and downright disgusting . i have been here a few times and it 's been less than favourable each time . their pizza is flavourless and bland .
dreadful , rude service- borderline bullies , poor selection , and they severely mark up their prices ! both my friend and i found a dress that they have at other stores for a fraction of the cost . unacceptable . what a joke , really .
food arrived late by almost 30 min , taste was mediocre at best , and 4 hours after eating only half of his orange chicken ( that was mostly bread without meat ) my husband was having explosive vomiting .
booked thru groupon , scheduled & got a no call no show , i rescheduled after getting an hour credit for my next cleaning but the lady they rescheduled me with barely cleaned anything , it 's like i could 've done this myself .
wilson parker homes are not quality built homes . the sheet rock is paper thin .
this location does not accept blue cross blue shield insurance and therefore my insurance is not covered . was to go to the mesa location .
do not order from this restaurant if you want it delivers within 45 min to 1 hour promised by the person took the order over the phone . just forget it ! this is the 3rd time they have done this to us !
what a huge disappointment ! lights looked store bought . nothing special ! better displays in neighborhoods . the business advertising signs made it even worse ! this was so unnecessary .
bad news all the way around . had wood look vinyl flooring laid 4 yrs ago . now all seams are in bad shape and have separated .
i had eaten at this establishment once before and was extremely pleased . today the soup was bland , the matzoh ball had no flavor , the bread was stale , and the meat was so dry it was hard to swallow .
buyer beware ! yes , they carry european bras and they are very well made . but , if you do n't like the merchandise for any reason , you will not receive a refund .
bad roach problem , management sucks , staff is clueless and always gets fired , but it 's cheap , u get what u pay for
avoid like the plague . this company does not stand by their work and refuses to pay for damages their responsible for .
i wish i could give a negative star . i have not had a positive experience with this place .
based solely on the previous reviewers good experience with this landscaper , i decided to give him a call . he was very nice on the phone , however he never showed up at my house to take care of my yard . no phone call , nothing .
my friend and i decided to visit this diner which is two blocks away from my apartment on a sunday am ( well . may be more like brunch ) . this place look so empty all the time so why not . the menu is mediocre .
so mad , i came in and ordered a 3 piece combo to go , and after waiting for a really long time , got home and found 3 wings for my 3 pieces . that 's ridiculous
so i have had these guys out twice to fix my dryer and it 's not fixed . now they wo n't return my calls or the property management company 's calls . the guy who came out was super friendly and nice .
i am a new pet owner and without asking around much , i took my 2 months old puppy to this clinic . that was the biggest mistake i made . they have the worst groomers !
i bought a groupon for 3 oil changes to this place and used up only 2 of my oil changes because the service was awful . the same man was working both times i went and i got really bad vibes from him .
i order the bake fish cole slaw and broccoli . i received 1 bake fish ( suppose to be two ) no broccoli , and 2 cole slaw , 1 of my cole slaw had an uncooked unknown piece of meat i the middle of it .
on september 15 , 2016 . i went to superior nails . i plan on going back just to show them what a horrible job nancy did ! streaks on fingernails ! pedicure was dangerous !
their falafels are salty and dry . their coleslaw has no dressing to it its just dry you need flavour . i 've tried the chicken skewers and their potatoes not too bad . they charge a lot for your food too expensive for not so good food .
how does this place have 3.5 stars ? if you have any taste whatsoever you will never go here . the beer is cheap , yes , but the food is disgusting and this place should be shut down imo .
yikes ! what happened to this place ? it 's filthy . so sad because it was a nice place to play and watch baseball & softball . the fields are worn down , bathrooms dirty , snack bars are grossly understaffed and trashed .
children are allowed at the bar while the adults drink . supervisor approves and says her son does the same and she does not see any issue .
be ware of towing fraud at this premises . my car was towed away from here even though i was a customer at this place and just had my lunch there .
i bought a living social for approximately $ 70 for a gift . my son moved and was unable to use the voucher and it had expired .
i have been here a handful of times over the last year , but during my last visit i vowed that i would never return . my feet were not in bad condition , so i requested just a quick polish change .
i purchased a laptop with best buy and was told that the total device protection plan was a full comprehensive service with a one time fee .
this business deserves a zero stars . like other reviewers have said , i also bought a groupon . attempted to contact 11 times , three voicemails and eight online requests for service ( groupon steps provided ) . no response .
do n't recommend this pollo loco , the manager roberto is super rude , he over charged me , i had to open a complain to get my money back waited for 2 weeks . they do n't even apologized to me .
really dirty and mediocre food . these guys need to go back up north and learn the trade . nothing to offer and crabby attitudes as well very sketchy people
came in for lunch , looking to order to go . stood at the register and watched the worker punch away at the register for 5+ minutes without even looking up . by the sounds of these reviews i may have been fortunate not to receive any food .
this was by far the worst nail salon i have ever been to . the person who did my nails was not paying attention and was very rough . then she cut my big toe not even close to the cuticle . just cut the toe .
the worst customer service . extremely rude and the indian lady yells at you . i was unable to come in and called multiple times to cancel and no one picked up . i suggested any other time and she refused to rebook me . will not be going there
this is the 3rd time in a row that i have paid for the hand wax service and have had to complain to the manager . because i have a new car , they think that you do n't notice that they 're not coating the car with wax .
not good as expected . me and my friends had diarrhea for the whole day after eating there . craving for hot pot and found it online but so disappointed . missed many of our orders . server was not polite and informative .
their knockoff of what once my favorite sub was horrendous . yet they still manage to charge more ! move along , people . there 's nothing to see here .
pure air service arizona is a terrible company . they try to trick you into buying extra services that are not worth what they charge . they also damaged my ceiling and then tried to hide the damage .
avoid this place - the service is horrible , the owner unfriendly , the inventory abysmal and they overcharge for their services .
if this is the only place available to you , keep going or sleep in your car . had to stay here for a week because of its proximity to nellis . will never make that mistake again . the room was awful . plumbing did n't work well .
service was n't really that great and the wait was too long . my burger came out dry and my friend 's bbq sandwich barely had any meat with only a mere three slices . her mom ordered a well-done steak , but that came out looking like coal .
he is a horrible person who puts used parts or wrong parts and claims they are new . took him 3 of my vehicles within a short period of time , and each one failed just as quickly .
i hired them to install a audio receiver and mount a tv . they come cheap but thats what you get - cheap service .
sucky wine selection ( nothing local ) , sucky food , sucky service . do your homework . go support a true local business that serves local wine . their passion surely shines through in their operations .
the handsome gentleman in the office was helpful in such a way that he found the error .
i want to start out with this . i am a natural dark blonde , my hair is not difficult to lighten or highlight and now i look like i 'm wearing a copper penny instead of blonde hair .
terrible , uneducated , dishonest . .a complete waste of time ! dont do it !
horrible horrible horrible . we ordered take out for the first time . we tried to figure out what goes with what , the menu above the counter was confusing . no one knew any answers , they kept having to go to 1 lady to ask .
this def not authentic mexican . charge extra for sour cream even tho i didnt get meat . super small burrito for $ 10 , kill me . go to a street vendor and get something ten times more authentic and delicious and cheaper .
slow making subs and service was far from perfect . the bread seemed to sitting out for quite some time so the bread was hard .
the ambiance is great do n't get me wrong . but given we had a staff of 3 waiters and we still had slow service is unbelievable . also the food was bland , over cooked and over dressed .
talk about family unfriendly ! no carts no baskets no where other then a metal bench to sit for children or you have to hopefully hold your clothes and your child at the same time .
i read the reviews before going here , but said screw it , '' my buddy was in town and we loved fox & hound in philly , so we went anyway . i ordered something i thought a restaurant could n't screw up - nachos .
i want to give it a no star at all !
bean and cheese burrito was awful . the beans tasted like the canned beans you buy at the supermarket . overpriced food . try filiberto 's instead . some of them have daily specials running monday thru friday .
worst place ever ! dropped my daughter off to get a trim she came out with choppy short layers and tears .
i ca n't wait until more fast food options open up around cotton . the only reason i go here any more is for the convenience in location .
i had my blood drawn and ended up 10 hours in er 2 days later for an infection . they did n't clean my skin well enough . speak up and make sure everything is clean .
i dare you to try and order food and drinks at the bar area here on a saturday night . not possible on under 3 hours . place is an absolute joke and only exists because the closest bowling alley it 's in lower burrell
shut this place down . fire everyone that works here . this is the last time i will ever go here .
we read a bunch on how tgi fridays has changed and is listening to guest . i would like to say the food and service was great . .but we go in there and there is a manager , hostess , and a waiter at the hostess both .
honestly i had a terrible experience at this location 's drive thru today . i wanted to order the sweet cream cold brew drink , and i was told they were out of cold brew . then i asked about doing a latte with coconut milk .
this is based on service tsa . stupidest employees ever ! we asked information if there was a starbucks by gates a and she said yes and there is none . glad they have an information desk .
i do n't understand why this place is over rate . the is just ok nothing special ! people is not friendly here .
sprint still has n't called back like promised & they still have n't resolved the issue .
the actual car wash was great . the people . eh . it was my first time , and rather than treating me nicely , i was treated as if the place were run by the soup nazi .
tried to order food . never showed up . after 2 hours we canceled the order . they just kept lying , telling us it was on the way . horrible waste of time .
worst customer service ever . i did n't know who worked there because no one greeted me or payed me any mind . a lady was within feet of me and i 'm looking at shoes no help no no
the restaurant is struggling with service . i 've been going to three birds for years , and the service has always been just right . no longer , and it 's not fun to wait 20 minutes for your server to come take your drink order .
maybe this passes for a serious steakhouse in san diego , but in las vegas where there are more steakhouses than starbucks , kelly 's ca n't compete . extremely overpriced , especially given that it 's off the strip .
i read previous reviews & thought this would be a great little hole in the wall . ugh . ordered a hamburger for grandson & he 's 4 & will eat anything but not this burger . hope we do n't get food poisoning .
was so excited when i heard the new restaurant was opening . the first time i went it was just blah , i chalked it up to being new . the second time was just worse . i will go to cafe 100 moving forward .
updating my previous 3 stars review . wow this place is becoming like majority of the other pawn shops . overpriced . you can tell the place hasnt sold much of their items . the shelves are full . .with the same items ive seen months ago .
rude owners , horrible service , and bland cheap , over priced food . did i mention rude owners ? i will never frequent this poor excuse of a restaurant again .
buyer beware ! when your clothes turn out fine , this place is great . if not , it will be your worst nightmare . this place has the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
dirty , nasty , scary .
there we go again . first americano came out flat like drip coffee and returned . the second not much better with the baristas not so pleasant attitude . more often than not there is a problem with this location . i should call central
terrible car wash . i will never go back here . if you value your car , do not go here . save some money and go over to quality scrub on state rd . this place needs to get their stuff together , what a mess .
horrible service . below average food . we were duped by other obviously fake reviews . i can not give any fewer stars than one star . to start with , the service was very slow -- despite the restaurant being half empty .
who reviews cvs well i do now . hire people ! no reason for 2 people to leave bc your 6 deep and got a lady w coupons . not to mention your pharmacy is just as bad . i 'll go to one on ray
booooo bed bugs everywhere . do not live here . staff here lies and not helpful .
i used to work here . yall are eating bug infested , roach infested food from a place that i knew for a fact the food was n't safe to eat . this is why i had to leave this job .
what ? no ranch ? i was truly flabbergasted when i was told i could n't have ranch dressing on my salad since they did n't serve it there any more . she said we were n't ever supposed to serve it but we did when we first opened .
stopped in at this sprouts for a quick meal , i normally go to the one at 3rd street , i purchased a meat loaf meal and this is what it looked like . the meat was defiantly raw . and tasted absolutely gross .
good luck trying to buy a bike here . 30min inside this place and not 1 person approached me . today i was ready to buy a bike and this would have been my first purchase .
very similar to another reviewer , i spoke with their front office almost 3 weeks ago looking for a quote and have yet to receive a call back . i understand that a delay is possible but letting the client know upfront would be appreciated .
very , very , very expensive and not flexible in how she works at all . can not recommend her to anyone .
3rd time . service very mediocre . bordering on terrible . food is average . wo n't be con
i have traveled numerous time on spirit , understanding that this is a low cost carrier and certain things come along with that . i am aware that bags cost more , and seats are separate , and to be honest . this is standard with most airlines now .
pretty bad , not clean , very noisey . did n't want to touch anything in the room .
i ordered 20 piece chicken nuggets , sweet tea , and french fries . i ask for extra ranch and it 's almost 30 cents for one small ranch .
if i could give them a zero i would ! i reserved my car online , i got there an hour later to pick up the car . when i got there i had to get in line .
i have never walked out of a port of subs before this . i love pos . my auto correct knows port of subs !
they let go of the good loving and caring teachers ! now both locations can suck . parents are not blind . you hire cheap staff parents will notice ! finding good people in henderson is a hard thing to do .
wow ! just wow ! lol so i found this place for my fiancé . obvious reasons , back and neck pain , and it 's very close to our house . the first three visits were good . no complaints .
they were out of chicken , then proceeded to argue with me as to why i wanted to wait for what i ordered . tried to get me to replace what i wanted with what they had already prepared .
its a nice facility however i notice that they allow kids to be running around messing with all the equipment while adults are trying to get a serious workout in . the classes are awesome .
wasted time and money , and damaged my hair because of extremely bad advice from one of the staff . had to chop it .
i 'm not sure if this place is under new management but last time i was here everything was great but not last night . the place felt sticky , dirty , and cheap . they served me coffee in a styrofoam cup and their food standards went down .
scam artist ! avoid , avoid , avoid ! i prepaid my 17 days rental car in order to have the best deal . i returned car 10 days earlier when they left me cut and dry with broken car for 2 days in another state .
there was a cockroach strolling on my table while i was eating . when i asked the waiter to remove it , he waited for about 30 seconds , like he was waiting for the bug to just crawl on its way .
i sent numerous letters ( since 2011 ) , i left voice messages , because nobody ever answers . i took countless e-mails , back and forth , and still nothing this has gone on for 5 years resulting in scarce replies back . i just want my prize .
horrible service . saturday night . 1030 . maybe 20 people in whole bar . outside open . several waitresses wandering around . no service at all . 15 minutes . seriously . get in gear . we left .
good portion of food , found it bland chicken was undercooked . service was dismal . wo n't be back .
well , since i did n't get to eat their food , i 'll give it a 1 star . ( i 'd give it 0 if i could . ) i got there at 11:45 before any major lunch rush to order a burger .
tacos are ok ; although , the rice taste like plastic and beans are always cold . even so beyond the lack of quality control and care , this place price gouges ; 4 dollar for bean and rice , 8 dollar guacamole and 8 for frozen churros .
can you say food poisoning ? got sick as dog 15 minutes after eating here . never again !
this place had the rudest customer service , it was horrible ! we came to celebrate a birthday and drove all the way from the west side of town just to try out the place . we noticed they forgot a couple dishes and we asked the server .
what is the deal with the new property management company ? everyone in the leasing office has a major attitude problem .
terrible . the food was disgusting , the chicken in my wrap looked like it came from a can . the bartender was also too busy talking to her friends and never brought out our appetizer that we ordered .
absolutely terrible . 20 minutes for menus , 55 minutes for food after ordering . major issues with each dish ( burned , missing ingredients , brown lettuce ) . avoid this place . tourist trap .
the doctors are good but the office staff is very unprofessional . i have been waiting for 2 months for them to get my prescription approved . i have been calling one to two times per week to no avail .
worst service ever ! completely under staffed and painfully slow . tea machine is broken . soda machine out of carbonation . definitely will not be returning to this location .
last time i went there the food is very bad .
this hotel has the worst customer service that i have ever seen . they were rude and the room was n't clean . they had several homeless people hanging out in the lobby .
this place sucks . do n't go here . and do n't fall for the groupon . i have been taught for the last time that if a restaurant has a groupon deal , there is a reason . we literally had no server for our entire time .
had issues scheduling a cleaning , was told it would take over two months until they were able to fulfill the groupon i purchased for their services . very unprofessional and helpless .
3 3 separate visits this location has failed to have the standard ingredients i needed for a recipe .
bad bad bad bad bad . if you appreciate customer service this is not the company for u as they have horrible customer service . worst pool cleaning service we 've ever had at our home . they have really bad customer service .
worst service in charlotte - consistently shitty service , always delayed , over-priced - do n't go there unless you want a crappy job done and to wait forever .
dunkin donuts has great coffee and doughnuts . however , this location needs some help . i went inside for a doughnut and an iced coffee . i waited 10 minutes for my coffee . after that i finally had to leave because i was late for work .
will never rent from hertz at the location again ! it is absolutely ridiculous to wait in line for over an hour to rent a car when you have a reservation .
i do n't think i ever been to one worst customer service and ripping me off and getting my order right i do n't think this is a place worth coming to .
was a very loyal customer and now will never go back to pawn first . the gilbert location was amazing . best staff ever and where always helpful !
the girl 's name who was doing my nails is christine , she was rude and not friendly at all ! not comfortable place and cost much money for nothing worth !
when for valentine 's day dinner . we had a 5pm reservation . we had to wait as the table was dirty from prior guests . we placed our drink order and waited 20 minutes for the drinks .
this place is awful . food was expensive and flavorless . i was tricked by the 5 star reviews and deeply regret wasting money at this place . i only hope that i do n't also get food poisoning . only time will tell .
dishes were very small . we got a salad that the waiter said should feed 2-3 people and we received 1 small bowl size of salad which ended up feeding one person and not ge . we ordered a caesar salad and pasta bowls .
i dislike making one star reviews . i am disappointed at this location . we have been there numerous times and the quality of food as well as the service continues to decline time after time .
had them do my interior concrete stain for my floor . the color was wrong and they did a very poor job . no quality whatsoever ! the people that stained my floors were all non english speaking also .
went to the dealership on december 27th and was totally blown off by the sales guy . he showed me 2 model cars and did n't even bother going over the financing with me .
this dd is alway crowded and way too loud . service is sloppy , but unfortunately the only dd for miles . always check your order before leaving as i have been given the wrong drinks and seen others given the wrong food and drink .
actually . .it 's a zero ! why kfc allows this place to carry its name is beyond me . the world 's worst food , and charging a fee for using a debit card . .really ? i hate this place !
starting to worry i 've been going for months . i just found out they are out of network for my insurance ! they repeatedly told me they were in network ! waiting to hear back from their billing department
do n't waste your time and money coming to this place . it 's 8am and i 'm sitting at the bar with the bartender having a pissy attitude b c i 'm just having water .
this place was awesome until i came in to order this evening . the cook was mopping the floor in the restroom . he was wearing gloves and he did n't change them out . he washed his hands with the same gloves and started preparing the food .
hit me if i come back . i had the misfortune of revisiting this place twice . and twice left regretting money spent and calorie wasted ( and i 'm not even health conscious ) .
not great . not even good . went in for coffee and got the worst service coupled with terrible coffee . the barista left my husband and my cups waiting while he flirted with a customer .
1st location whos breakfast hours dont match with company policy . reason why i go to jack in the box .
this place is horrible ! the service is the worst you will get at any sushi place i 've been to . i went for lunch one day and ended waiting over an hour to get my meal and the bill .
i visited indeed for a 45m massage on monday . the massage room smelled like a hospital . i was ready to walk out but was embarrassed to do so since an appointment was booked .
wow what a disappointment for a restaurant in a prime location ! look forward to the new tenants soon because this place is not going to make it ! cons 1 . wine prices for the amount of wine you receive - very tiny glasses 2 .
this place is horrible , the management sucks i live here and i 'm counting down my days until my lease is over . i 'm new to las vegas so i was n't aware at how bad this area was .
read the expiration dates ! i have personally seen expired items like cheese and eggs on shelves . they are very bad about inventory and restocking . the starbucks girls are great but beware of produce and refrigerated items .
worse restaurant in hudson . not impressed . this place will not last long . reminds me of a college bar with no thought put into its design or atmosphere . clearly the owner or designer has never owned a restaurant . the acoustics were awful !
the floor is very arrogant knowing that there are long list of players that they do not care if they miss players due to their mistakes .
this place is n't even worthy of a star . yes , it 's still open but do n't go . it 's nasty ! we pulled in and i had a creepy feeling !
so i 'll keep this short - need a basic job done ( break pads ) on my 2001 toyota sienna van - expected cost $ 200 - $ 250 .
definitely disrespectful service , being hung up on twice while placing an order over the phone .
i am more than disappointed with the food received ! i ordered tiger prawns in general tso sauce and what i received was an insult to my love for that dish . there was a putrid smell that was accompanied by a horrible old taste .
requested a quote on multiple items . the person who showed up was clearly not interested in doing the first two main projects that i had specifically requested when making the appointment . i was promised a quote the next evening but never got it !
we are not allied to store our own items in the minibar fridge . $ 30 fine if we do . for that sls , you get one star
if you 're looking for something classy , this is not it . this place is kind of trashy . so are the performers . it 's just tacky . would n't recommend it if you 're looking for a tasteful cabaret .
this gas station sucked . i am an avid esso customer as this is the only gas company i go to for gas & aeroplan .
i had this company come out about 2 weeks ago , they came and attempted to clean my carpet . i looked like all they did was vacuumed the carpets . then the guy who they sent over was like oh if you want deep clean its $ 299 .
booked this limo company for my boss ' . the limo was dented . the driver did n't follow requests for specific scenic routes .
forced to eat here again today due to proximity to work . tuna sandwhich tastes like cat food . please someone teach them how to rinse and drain tuna well prior to adding mayo and other ingredients . will not be forced to eat here again .
very disappointed . a very stressful experience for the men in our wedding party . would never use this place again .
lost my bag but still charges me to carry it . when it arrived half empty no one would pick up the phone . on the return , would not let me check in ourselves or the bag online ! eventually turned out more expensive than other airlines .
what a complete disappointment this place was .
typically , i am a very positive person and have no problem supporting local non-chain businesses . we came here to get my son 's haircut since they were advertised open until 8pm . got here at 6:45pm and was told the barber was closed for the evening .
we bought a lg french door refrigerator from this store . when it was received it was missing the glass shelf . the manager said that he would replace it and that it was on order . it never came . when i asked again for it .
ordered this pizza for a party , we all thought it was average pizza at best on top of their rude customer service . wo n't be ordering again .
convenient location but some of the staff has been rather rude at more than one occasion . which is rather unusual for shoppers dm
the reject spot on king west . food , atmosphere , service is terrible . stay away
this costco location is unreal . they had three people working the customer service counter , and no one said boo to me for twenty minutes even though i was standing at an open register .
i chose sassi as the venue for our family 's mother 's day brunch celebration expecting an excellent culinary experience . it was absolutely the worst brunch i 've ever had in the valley .
ok , i have never heard this before . me : are there happy hour food specials ? server : yes , these appy 's are only $ 5 during happy hour . ( reg $ 8 ) server : oh and by the way they are half orders .
over thought . under portioned . way too expensive . too top it off . they are so cool it hurts . one the most disappointing nights out in a long time . good cocktails . bad wine selection .
i have been shopping at macy 's for years , and in all fairness have given this location many chances to change my negative opinion . it is so hard to ever locate a sales associate , and when you do they are rude .
terrible experience . the phone receptionist straight out lied to me that a driver was en route when he was n't . two hours later , i called and a different receptionist said an order had not even been made in my name .
worst kfc i ever been to ! asking for extra honey mustard . they just ignored me . must be expensive ! i guess i will bring business somewhere else .
very weird and awkward place . i doubt this place will be in business long . nobody in my family enjoyed their yogurt and letting kids dish and top their own , and then pay by weight turned out to be a huge waste of money .
this place smelled . they would n't let me see a puppy unless i really want to buy it .
i wish i could give this place zero stars . the server was obnoxious , did n't know the menu , could n't answer a simple question about what comes on the burger .
horrible , horrible , horrible company be careful of the appliance or electronic you buy because if they hold the warranty and something goes bad most likely they will find a way not to honor it . the customer services sucks and they can barely speak english . beware
staff is not interested at all to work with kids . they hangout between themselves . arrogant workers at the cashier . it 's just 2.5 $ entry fee place air stinks , no ventilation here . take your kids somewhere else .
i dont even think its open anymore . i can understand why . husband and i got a babysitter and went out to enjoy dinner . we got a table for two about a foot of room on either side of us from other tables .
after getting lost and calling for directions and telling rick '' i was close and would be there in five minutes i arrived to find a dirty place .
i have been a long time regular , but tonight was the worst experience i have had .
i spent more hours waiting than having any work done and had to continually return due to a variety of errors .
sweet baby jesus praise the good lord have mercy on my nails . i came to this salon and i asked for short , rounded tips . very natural looking . the woman who was doing them must have heard , give me the shark tooth special ! ''
we drove by today and the shop is completely empty with chain link fence all around it . i 'm assuming it 's closed .
awful . they do a bait and switch with their drink specials '' so beware . the place is filthy and waiters are overwhelmed .
ca n't i give them 0 stars ?
these guys are complete crooks ! was leaking transmission fluid , brought in to inspect . they call me back & say they need to remove the transmission to find the leak and that will cost $ 600 , then the actually repair costs on top of that amount .
maybe i 'm biased because i 'm from texas , but the food was not good . very bland but also odd tasting . the lime margarita was very sweet and very acidic . i had the braised short rib chimichanga and was incredibly disappointed .
took them 30 minutes past the pickup time to have my rapid pickup meal ready . offered no compensation whatsoever - food was thrown together and my frozen mocha was completely melted by the time they gave it to me .
must read parents beware ! there is an older child there that is abusing the children in the tunnels and the staff do not care nor watch the children !
i do n't think i 've ever had a worst breakfast . i had the mexican scramble . it was nothing more than a pile of near raw potatoes with s small amount of tasteless chorizo on top .
i have given this place the last chance . chili verde tostada was cold , flavorless , slop .
we were visiting cleveland for a sports tournament and i brought my daughter in for an ankle injury . this was the wort experience ever ! the facility is dated , messy , and overpowered by air freshener .
i spent $ 9,000 on a backyard project . as part of the project , he installed 5 trees , and we were told we had a one-year warranty . one tree was dying immediately .
here 's the deal . i came to get a work card . waited 4 hours to go through the process . they do not give you the card after the 4 hour process nor do they mail it to you .
ordered a cafe au lait meant to be made with espresso and was given previously brewed coffee . and it tasted awful . will never be returning .
cleaning lady knocked on my door 8am , asked me if i want to check out . shampoo , conditioner and body wash were empty . door and lamp were bad . i was very disappointed .
they do not help and lie to you and take your money not worth it i do not suggest this school at all
today i was given partially cold on the inside burrito , cooking and service got worse .
our group of 7 waited for food and never received some of our food . what we received was good , but we had to ask multiple times for water , more fries and some of our orders . was very disappointing as this was not our usual experience .
let 's see .
i shop here . i wish i did n't , but i do . i 'm always annoyed w the service & the people who work here . specifically the cashiers . the prices are high , so high !
this place is poorly run with no communication and extremely rude management . if your looking for a cheap place , this is great . but if you are looking for a professional grooming with love . i would go somewhere else . highly disappointed !
this place was horrible . they told me they did n't take reservations and to call ahead ( on a tuesday ) so i did . they told me it was a 45 minute wait and said they text me . without asking for my number .
absolutely disgusting service . sat down for twenty minutes and did n't even get a single person to get our order . a dozen people came in after us and were all served and had received their drinks .
i found their food to be overpriced and small portions . so disappointing in this nice new space .
this office is horrible ! you go in one doctor tells you one thing then they send you over to a pac who will not help at all .
my husband and i purchased a puppy from this shop . after we took her home , we had scheduled a vet appointment to get her all looked at . she had so many health problems . she had mange , an ear infection , and kennel cough .
hired a new company and our place was rented in 48 hrs and for $ 150 more than what this place said we would get . we even had several tenants to pick from at a more appropriate price .
this place is gross . it 's overcrowded , has rude staff and sticky floors . it also attracts a questionable type of crowd . a sixty year old woman in a tube top tried to fight me - nuff said .
i went to get my eyebrows waxed for the first time there and it was painful . the lady used tweezers and just hacked at my eyelids , disregarding whether she was plucking skin or not .
hello yelp . .place been closed for months and being torn down , i 've heard for condos .
be careful about giving your phone number to this organization ! they will call you so frequently it becomes harassment ! i receive phone calls from the red cross every other day or so .
horrible . the 24 hour unlimited rides pass for residential and the strip routes ( $ 7 ) is good , but this bus route is not . the deuce is a double decker bus that serves the strip and downtown .
service has went to shit . not sure if management changed or what happened but i loved this place & have been taking my car here for a couple years now with above and beyond great service !
came in on . tuesday for lunch . let 's hope dinners later in the week are better . it 's too bad . no martini glasses so it came in a champagne flute . took way too long to get our drinks .
i 'm guessing this chain got their name by the way their establishments smell inside . in case you 're wondering . that smell would be comparable to hairy , smelly buffalo roaming . yes , indeed . the wait for a drink was just shy of 30 minutes .
i was very disappointed with my experience at this restaurant . it was far too pricey for what it was , the food did not meet the quality expected ( very salty ) , and the portion sizes were extremely small .
if i could star it nothing i would ! the employees are awful ! so rude and unattentive .
if i could give it zero stars i would . i am not going waste any more of my time with this establishment . they just suck .
they accept '' ebay as a valid purchase '' for their warranty and take your money .
i love the product , but the lady behind the counter could really use some customers service skills . it 's totally not my fault she has to work there . also , do n't expect to get it to go . apparently they no longer have lids .
the wendy 's on cochran road is literally the worst franchise i 've ever encountered . the service in the location is terrible . the restaurant is dirty . the operator of this location should lose his franchise over how bad this location is managed . it 's pathetic .
they do not speak english clearly . service was terrible . save your time and money and go elsewhere .
my husband spoke to the manger and she told him there 's is nothing she can do for him ! well we sure did something , filed at complaint at bbb for this scam of a company !
this review is based on my experience last year . i came across this and saw all the good reviews and i felt compelled to write this . the food here is disgusting and so is the way it is prepared .
i love steak n shake . this one , however , leaves a lot to be desired . the food often comes out cold and the servers are apathetic at best . most of the time , they 're downright rude .
worst fast food experience ever ! out of all the different places i 've gotten food , whether it 's fast food places or restaurants , this little caesar 's is by far the worst place i 've ever been to .
i would highly advise against bringing in your cat . the only things that went right are that the vet techs are very nice and good with the animals , and the billing person was friendly .
horrible food ! i sent my first meal back and the second was just as bad ! do n't waste your money at this establishment ! even the chips were stale !
just dropped off my car for a detail i purchased a week ago and i was told by the guy for $ 80 he would get me the detail with 3 free car washes .
horrible service , bad property mgmt co , unacceptable performance overall . i am an owner and the tenant had paid on time but rpm west did n't mail me the checks . they skipped 2 months !
come on mcdonalds , you can do better than that ! last week i ordered an egg white delight and got a regular egg mc muffin , today i ordered an egg mc muffin and got a sausage mc muffin with egg .
ordered a medium pizza online 5pm for pickup 7:15 pm . the pizza was n't even ready and my wife had to wait additional 15 minutes ! when she brought the pizza home it looked like it was pulled from the trash and was beyond salty .
this place was gross . the pizza was bland and had no flavor , the salads were the same , but drenched in dressing and soggy . the tables had residue on them , and i did n't want to eat on them .
do not go here ! i have been going here for probably 15 years but things have gone way down hill in the last few years . my last two appointments have been some of the worst of my life .
$ 15 for an acrylic fill and charged me $ 20 . i asked why and the lady ( lily ) who was doing my nails said they charge extra for long nails .
i am still waiting to see if if crooked dump closes down , rude service and dishes are watered down with plenty of veggies and no meat , the ole bait and switch ! do n't waste your money here !
poor quality of food and pricy . service too fast , 2 minutes ready from time of order .
we 've given this place a solid try . the few times we 've gone the food was good but the service is really bad ! mgmt needs to hire and get the staff some help !
not a good experience here at all . they rushed through my manicure and finished in about 10 minutes . it was almost as if the employees were trying to get done as quick as possible to compete for who got the next customer .
disappointed in the customer service of oxford dry cleaners . they lost articles of clothing and refuse to reimburse . summer , the manager is claiming that they can only offer in store credit .
so , my husband and i are staying at inn on eagle mountain . we order food from here . after and hour , we receive part of our order ( missing a salad ) and no silverware or napkins .
absolutely the worst experience i have had with an service company , and that 's . not easy to say ! i have had two appointments with them and both times they have exceeded their 4 hour appointment window without calling .
food was great . service was terrible . they forgot half my order then when i went inside to get the rest , i was given attitude as if i was an inconvenience to them .
this place was great until they put a limit on your drinks not for 20 bucks i should get more than 2 drinks of cheap alcohol come on really are you that cheap its not even top shelf
changed to ones star . i value the help i get from the front guys . they 're awesome and bend over backwards . problem is the back . brought our new truck here for an oil change since i love this place .
greated with a warm hello . server was pleasant , but was semi knowledgeable about the menu , it was her first day . once food arrived there was instant disappointment . yelp pictures created an anticipation that was not fulfilled .
i ordered a quarter chicken dinner to go . quarter is right . the chicken was the size of a quarter ( 25 cents ) that is . i do n't know what size chicken that meal came from . i will never go to this place again .
horrible ! the pizza is burnt cold and delivery always takes over 45 minutes ! i will never order from them again !
took a couple minutes for the workers who i was standing right in front of even acknowledged me . then continuous umc infomercials with obnoxious music on tv blasting you out of the waiting room . no reading , no resting , no relaxing .
i had the shrimp scallops and calimari . it was pretty bland . we had the only japanese cook and he was the only one who could n't spin knives . throw things in the air etc . was dissapointed .
if it was possible to give a lower rating i would . do not go to this dealership under any circumstances . they use hard old school pressure tactics that make you very uncomfortable .
awful . the owners are so rude and the nail specialist are very unprofessional . do not come here i came here because of the great reviews on yelp but i am extremely disappointed with the customer service and the way my nails came out by ani .
literally the worst dinning experience of my life ! the order was promised for 20mins , my husband went to pick it up and waited for 1 1 2 hours .
i have been a dedicated bcbg customer for many years . my experience this evening at bcbg at the forum shops in lv was less than stellar .
we wanted to try this place since we love mediterranean style cuisine , it 's close to home , and it was quick and easy . we walked in to the girl at the counters back facing us .
oh my god . the quality of the food is n't like any other burger king . there doing something wrong and they do n't care . do yourself a favor people , read everyone else 's post ' pretty similar .
made a special reservation for my son 's 21st birthday party . the entire family flew to las vegas for this event . we have some food allergies and i spoke with the manager upon making reservations that our party of 10 could not order family style .
sub standard service in an overly loud environment made for a disappointing night out with friends . the food was mediocre at best , the chips were seasoned and the queso was cold ( major points against for any mexican joint worth its weight ) .
unless you are maybe in a league this is the worst possible bowling alley you could go . they are majorly understaffed , rude and try the prices are extremely high . expect to pay tons of money and get shirt service .
somebody needs to train the employees to greet customers , say thank you and smile ! i counted 10 people working behind the counter and did n't see a single person smile to a customer . my cashier acted like i was disturbing her .
the worst bank i have ever dealt with . i really do n't wish to write a bad review , but the staff are rude , lazy and the services is horrible . i 've had nothing but bad experience with this bank .
new owners have destroyed this place . no garlic for some reason in food now ? you ca n't even request it . no showmanship from the chef . no volcano . no nothing . server was not very good , would say almost rude .
best advise to give , save yourself the time , effort and unnecessary aggravation and just drive to one of the other locations . do not waste your time here . not only will you receive the help you need , but any additional information , paperwork etc .
i use to work here , the kitchen is swarmed with roaches !
i do n't know if the previous yelpers ate at the same restaurant as i did but this was quite possibly the worst food i 've had in years .
worst pharmacy service ever ! do n't bother with them and go to walgreens . they have terrible customer service . long lines . do n't waste your time .
whoever the blonde who claims she is store manager is in this store . smh . makes me wonder how you became a manager . i do not appreciate you briefly asking me if i need help and then to become condescending and treat me like im beneath you .
came in for lunch and had poor service . have been here before and never experienced slow service like this . we waited 25 minutes just to order , food took a while and the order was n't correct . very disappointed .
ugh . .i see a slow death here . too many hotels provide friendlier service and atmosphere . a huge mistake off the strip .
okay , im seriously like not picky when it comes to this , i just want a good paint job and no dry skin left .
the office is small and old . the receptionist has good attitude but the doctor is terrifying . he tried to persuade me to get a root canal on a tooth which potentially needs a root canal .
the worst customer service ! lazy , unhelpful , disrespectful ! fedex is about to loose me as a customer !
made a reservation for a table seat . got there and waited literally 43 minutes for our omakase sushi plates ( 13 pieces ) to arrive .
the espresso was not good and it was even worse that the mocha did not mask the flavor . i ordered both a shot of espresso and separately a mocha and tried them both . both were bad .
i do n't know what their deal was this time . usually the food was good . my husband order our normal meal that we get from panda express .
again we love this restaurant ! food is delicious , reasonably priced and great service from j.r. . and you have to go on friday the clam chowder was amazing .
completely unprofessional . i had a groupon & they said i had been there b4 & could n't use my groupon . i have never been there & wanted to try it as they had good reviews .
upper management needs to take a good look at the employees at this location . they are rude at best . the portions are smaller than any other chipotle . this is my second time here and the service is worst that last time . not coming again !
i was there recently with a group of 5 for winterlicious . we were passed a few times by other staff before anyone acknowledged us . service was extremely slow despite the fact that the restaurant was relatively busy .
omg ! what is the rave about ? this place is disgusting ! it 's dirty and the food is not worth it ! i came here with my family and we each order a little bit of everything that is suppose to be good and popular there .
had a horrible experience and we never even ordered ! went on sunday night and was seated promptly . we then waited and waited and waited .
had a horrible experience last night with the staff when my sister was admitted . they refused to answer my questions about what would happen or who was in charge .
i have a deal for the employees at this mcdonald 's . if you just once ensure that what i ordered ends up in my bag when i drive away then i might consider supporting your effort to get $ 15 hour .
this place appears to be closed . we went ( after reading the rave reviews here ) on july 21 , 2012 and the place had a for rent sign in the window . bummer !
the staff is very friendly and nice location . that 's the only plus here . bathrooms are majority handicap , with a chair in the shower , makes showering very awkward .
we came here because it was recommended on a tv show . we are so disappointed ! i ca n't even begin to tell you how slooooow the food and drinks were to come out . the mojito was horrible . way too much lime juice .
one of the worst places to shop . please watch your wallet at all times . it feels extremely unsafe in the parking lot and in the store . well shopping there today a lady tried to steal laundry detergent .
terrible service and even worse food . much better food right around the corner at earl of sandwiches , and i do n't work at either place just wanted to give readers another option close by pampas
went to get my truck smog . someone was already there so i parked and went up to talk to the guy . he said to pull up after the car was done and left .
very disappointed ! vera 's house of bridal is very unprofessional . i made an appointment on saturday january 10th at 2:30 as a return customer to try on a dress that i am interested in purchasing .
saw the bad reviews this ramen shop had , but i went here anyway . this is the only ramen place we got in town anyway . the ramen is bad . the broth is bland . noodle is hard . pork taste like rubber . expensive .
this place is the worst i only go here because they carry certain things i need but sevice is terrible and rude
security personnel extremely rude .
if zero stars is an option , that was what i would vote for . i 've been there multiple times , and the pasta is atrocious . the other stuff is tolerable . the toasted garlic bread us better than any of their pasta dishes .
when we called in our office order the man who answered the phone was extremely rude . absolutely zero courtesy ! we felt rushed when ordering and when we asked what the delivery time looked like he refused to answer .
i called them to help me with my travel needs and i let her know that i was a platinum american express member and it went down hill from there . rude . she did n't want to help me at all . so i did n't let her !
their large margarita is more like mini margarita . the mole looked and tasted more like super salty gravy . one mole plate , one bean burrito and two small margaritas ended up costing $ 34 .
i bought a car here on 7 . 31 . my plates have still not arrived ! a $ 399 dollar dealer documentation fee for plates and i 'm driving around on expired tags and they wo n't help . these guys suck .
def not ever coming back . staff change , man talking crap about how if you change your head light and touch the wrong part it 's burns out .
unfortunately this time the pizza and the sub were very dry and overcooked . i ordered white sauce on my pizza and did n't get any sauce at all . pizza was way overcooked . really disappointed .
still no change to this place . it 's still disgusting and food inedible . please pittsburghers do n't let a buffet attract you to this restaurant , the owner of india garden is the same as all india !
if i could give this place less than 1 star i would ! the drive thru service here is totally ignorant . all they have to do is read the screen and put the right food in the bag , in my case put the right amount of food .
lacking in customer service , unhappy employees unable to hide bad attitudes , and minimal service provided to qualify as a mani-pedi . purchased a special on living social for my wife . first scheduled appointment was never recorded and she wasted a trip .
i 've been to every espresso royale in urbana-champaign and have been a customer since 2010 . however , this specific location continuously provides the poorest service . the staff is very rude , and much of my complaint rests with them .
what a terrible terrible experience , maybe my worst dinning experience of all time . dull boring inside , rude staff who did not want to interact with the diners , food was just slammed on the table .
i eat here fairly often , and usually the food and service are ok . when the service is bad , though , it 's really bad !
swell on camelback has lost a customer . me and from now on i will not refer to its location or products every time i refer a patient no record is being kept why waste my breath ? it takes two seconds to put in a note .
ordered traditional pad thai : this is ketchup and canned pasta . really not good , or remotely genuine at all . do not recommend this at all .
this company is unethical and a fraud . i purchased vouchers that said no expiration and the vendor said they were expired and that dealfind would refund them , i called them and they would n't said their policies had changed .
had the pork green chili plate . it was more a rice and bean plate . the portion of pork and chili was pathetic . i asked the waiter if it looked right and he said yes . there were only 6 tiny pieces of pork .
my husband and i decided to check this out , and purchased discount tickets on the strip . even at half off , i feel like we threw our money away ! the comedians were amateur at best , and this includes the headliner .
i 've been to this taco bell twice through the drive thru and both times i sat waiting for 10 mins before i even got to the area where you place your order as they take forever !
terrible service , over priced , terrible food . beans are out of a can . we live 1 mile a way in summerlin and will not be back . we were really hoping it would be great so cal mexican food but not so .
i just finished my salad here with no cheese and taco lettuce ( instead of the salad lettuce ) watched 2 other customers leave because of the same issue , and 6 complain ! just in the 30 minutes i was here .
i had my cracked screen replaced for $ 118 . within 90 days i was having issues with my phone dropping calls , etc . i took it to apple and they assessed saying my screen was separating from housing potentially causing the issues .
worst salon customer service ever , however the prices are those of an upscale place . do n't be fooled . a bunch of bridesmaids went in to get updos for a wedding , and they charged whatever they felt like without an explanation .
the staff here has obviously never heard the phrase check your attitude at the door . ''
we 've had poopy do for a couple of years now . like others who have reviewed the service we 've had times that they just stopped showing up . we would call and carl would say that somehow we fell off '' of the computer list .
my sister used this company . when she called for help in the middle of the summer they could n't come our for a couple of days .
a group of us decided we want to give them a shot . all signs said they opened at 11:00 am . we arrived a little early at 10:55 so we waited in the car till 11:00 , went and tried the doors , locked .
service was non existent and they did not make me feel welcome at all here .
if i could give them no stars , i would . do not use this company ! they are all rude , angela especially . i had to call them every day to make sure my signs were being done .
why would you make an appointment for they ca n't run on time ever ? 3 different locations . what a joke !
if i could give this place zero stars , i would . have gone to this place twice . they are extremely stingy when it comes to giving you a decent amount of food for the price .
awful with their contracts ! we signed up for a month to month contract knowing we were building a home and now they are telling me we have a termination fee due to canceling prior to 1 year ! i never signed a one year contract !
stay away from this restoration company . make sure you have everything in writing of what they are going to do for your house . they promised to do everything just to secure the job . but will not follow through .
called for an appointment at 1pm and was told to come on down for our 2 dogs . get here at 2pm and told the groomers left for the day . i 'm confused , your groomers left for the day but your open until 5 ?
one star for location and store the manager of hair salon . did my hair once my lord .
this is a response to matt as it will not allow me to reply . answer this : the terrible screen you put back on has absolutely no touch issues it is just with the non apple screens you are putting on .
my daughter and i went to this nail salon today , i got this nail tech , who had her son with her while she was working , she was dealing with him the most of the time .
customer service skills need to be sharpened . they were condescending , and laughed at me when i had a question .
they refer me to a specialist bc my results were abnormal . they ca n't get their fax machine to send the results to the specialist after i asked them to do so 3 times . they 're recommending for me to deliver the results myself .
horrible experience 1st time for the grooming services . made an appointment last week for a dog grooming right before christmas . got there and the groomer would not accept without rabies papers .
food was good but the delivery man was so rude . i ordered food from here and 90 minutes later my order finally arrived .
have ordered here 4 times and the order has never been right . the receipt always reads correctly , but when you look in the bag something is missing or if its all there you start to eat only to find you 've been given the wrong sandwich .
seated promptly , but after 15 minutes had still not been acknowledged by wait staff . proceeded to leave and go somewhere else .
while the food and the selection of bowls is great , they are pricey and the wait time is ridiculous . i took my husband here ( my third time ) and we waited 45 minutes for two bowls and there were maybe five of us in the store .
soggy pizza and the guy at the counter tried to keep my change . we would not go back nor suggest to anyone . man at the counter put my change in his tip bowl and as i held my hand out asks you wanted your change ?
my experience at the store is very upsetting . first of all , they do not accept debt making my friend and i pay in cash with our subway $ .
this place is a glorified dorm . over expensive , unhelpful and the management just wants to snatch up your student loans . they do n't use the roommate matching or whatever they want to call it , they are just trying to fill the rooms up .
selection is over priced and staff is rude . i found something in warehouse in the back . $ 3 pillow . they would not let me pay at the front register . it seems warehouse items must be purchased there .
the line gets extremely long ! i waited in line for over 25min just to buy a $ 3 ice cream sandwich ! nope ! they should have a separate register open to make things go faster . the 1 start is for the line .
we ordered the pork belly lechon over the phone . i guess i expected too much . this lechon was very salty ! unedible . the owner was saying to use the vinegar to decrease the saltiness . i say why not decrease the amount of salt used .
i 'm writing to save you so money . my husband and i went to for dinner over an hour before closing time and were extremely disappointed . over half the items were empty and the ones that were there had a spoonful left .
i order from this jimmy johns often . however they are no longer freaky fast . last 3 orders have taken over 45 minutes to deliver . i put in the tip online when paying in hopes of them seeing my generous tip however that doesnt speed them up .
came to get a cake for the wife , got there around 5:30pm . while i expected there would n't be anything left , i was lucky to get a cake .
this place is a joke . nothing to do with their tv ads . hahaha . not one specialist '' in sight any time , any day i go .
poor customer service . 150 dollar piece of junk they would n't stand behind spent money dollars there and they got my last one with this purchase .
trash trucks at 5am . trash odor . insane noise . drunk people urinating & vomiting staff and units are nice but nobody seems to care about other serious problems . there are only two very slow elevators that seem to break far too often for a new building .
second worse food i 've eaten in az since moving here 11 years ago . this place has nothing in common with the sit down steak and shakes back east . really limited menu , walk up ordering like any other fast food place .
i understand i went on a sunday afternoon , their busy time .
i wish i could give 0 zeros for this place maybe that 's why their place does n't have business . some may have good reviews but my experience was n't the best i was expecting an apology but instead i was told i was wrong .
my mistake for trying this place again after more than 3 years . i promised my self not to come here anymore because of lack of experienced and no customer service .
this place is just plain nasty and overpriced . it is basically a cafeteria for the state farm offices in marina heights but technically i think the public could go in there . do n't .
i attempted to return a faulty vape fluid here once and they called to have my car towed . not exactly the must adult response to a customer service request , methinks .
worst hot and sour soup ever . i complained and they said they would make me more soup . just like yesterday , they made a big batch , heated some for me and put in vegetables and meats .
not happy . we went there by default because the korean bbq next door was closed before the time posted . we just came off the airplane and was hungry . we order the pho and it did n't taste like pho .
very slow service , there were maybe 10 customers on a weekday night . a few couples and single guys at the bar . oh and ladies , do not go to the restroom alone !
12 31 14 . diner is reportedly under new management . had been there a couple years ago and food and service were excellent . today , though , we had terrible customer service and sub-par food . we were ignored when we entered , seated ourselves .
if you want a 5 dollar car wash for 26 bucks , this is your place . i paid 26 dollars for the super wash .
try to catch this place when things are slow . when things get busy , they start closing down registers so that they can generate long lines .
i 've had some good experiences there before . they have some creative menu items for a burrito place . however , last week i ordered their new sweet and spicy tofu burrito .
i 'm going to keep this updated . i have had my baby girl here in 2011 . the place was horrible . i have brought my girl home several times with rashes .
surgery was okay , but they wo n't bill my insurance correctly . consequently they collected too much money from me and will not refund my $ 250 .
shabby , dirty place . waited 30 minutes for to-go sushi when i was told it would be 15 , when i got it home it was falling apart . will never be back .
i really ca n't comment as to the quality of the car wash because i ca n't even apparently get anyone to notice there is a car sitting there ! this has happened to me twice and i will not be back to jacksons a third time .
the original penguin closed its doors on 10 24 . now , different people run it . if you 're looking for the food and atmosphere that you found before october 2010 , you 'll have to look elsewhere .
i hope if you use this company you have a lot of extra cash . i was in an accident and metro pd had my car towed to snap towing lot .
i wish i could give a negative star ! smells bad , dirty , unfriendly staff ( not even a greet when my family came in ) , inappropriate dress code . i sat next to a group of teens that swore a lot .
do n't use these guys . i used them for a change of locks when we bought a new house , and the guy took forever .
very disappointed ! the bagels just keep getting smaller and the price keeps getting larger . the last time i was there , i ordered a dozen bagels to go and the bagels were so small . not sure i 'll be back . usually a weekly sunday visitor .
terrible service . do n't waste your time or money here . went in looking for a football shirt , they had a couple on clearance .
service was good , food was poor quality and poorly prepared . price was to high for the food quality .
the only reason this hooters gets 1star is because my nachos were on point and the ladies looked amazing ! i must say i sat at my table for at least 15 minutes before i was given a flat beer .
probably wo n't be back again . the food was decent but not worth what was being charged .
i went there for an oil change and they said i needed a very expensive repair . they quoted me a price and i scheduled an appointment for another day . when i went back the price went up drastically and then they played the game of oh .
talk about a crappy leasing company with the worst policies . .the economy is bad and i am in a commission based job . i was n't able to pay rent in the 1st . i knew i 'd be a week late waiting on a paycheck .
regardless of the time of day their delivery is always over an hour . on several occasions they have sent the wrong order and the food has arrived cold !
good food . worst service on earth . staff has no idea what is in their food . manager argued when we got bill with multiple errors . too bad we will never go back because of horible experience because food was pretty good .
celebrated a special event here with my lovely wife . our food was very good . the service was excellent . why one star ? chilean sea bass was offered as one of the specials .
went there and ordered a burrito asking for no guacamole , get all the way home with my food expected to be right . take a bite out of my burrito what do i find ?
we ended up being able to book the castle at ashley manor and we are so pleased with our experience there . the staff was kind and friendly , even when our photo shoot ran a bit over schedule .
stay away , depo sold me two used tires 4 days ago and my front end now has a vibration .
worst place ever ! the service was the worst ! do n't ever go there ! people who works there sucks ! go somewhere else ! this is not good place to go. that so mean and unfriendly !
i went to the cafe again today for the first time in a long time . i ordered 3 of the cilantro fish tacos . first of all , they were super small for $ 9 .
had a 6:30pm reservation , were n't seated until close to 7pm . did not receive our food until 9:00 ! we had to cancel our plans we had for after dinner .
this company was so unprofessional , i was trying to schedule to get my carpets cleaned and the man who picked up the phone was extremely aggressive and terrible customer service .
had lunch there in the weekend , both me and my wife got stomach sickness afterwards , will never go again . super buffet was way better , cleaner and better choices .
was looking to compare cars and the sale guy was so aggressive with the sale and got personally that if i left without buying that he ca n't feed his twins . seriously bad sales pitch .
wish i could give zero stars . arranged for them to help us assemble an apartment full of furniture . never showed up . never got a phone call .
wtf , this starbucks do not participate in rewards program , so you ca n't even use stars you 've earned from starbucks app .
i almost threw up after eating the burrito . the carne was so bland . as if they put left over meat in my burrito . the torta was ok , but too wet . i thought it would be good . but it was horrible haha .
went there to get my hair and make up done for my wedding . left there very disappointed . i had to fix make up after leaving salon . showed her picture of what i wanted and she did not even come close to what i asked for .
extremely poor quality food . the majority of our chicken were fat , and my wife and i both returned our food and got our money back after pulling chicken bones out of our sandwiches . the flavor was bland and the customer service below average .
not a very good experience !
jack astor 's is the kind of place people go to who have no idea about food . or maybe they want to be seen on the patio on john .
most probably worse izakaya in montreal from what i 've tasted so far . their dishes either lack taste or taste overly sweet . the ramen was 12 $ , the noodles were n't fresh , soup was n't even real .
$ 100 cover for two ladies and two guys an hour before closing ? no way . total scam . would n't go here if they 're so willing to over charge .
all you can eat ? more like , how long can you starve '' . with a group of around 25 , i 'm sure they made a decent profit . especially since after 40 min of waiting we got our first round of sushi .
they really do n't even deserve the one star but if you are ordering for delivery expect it to be at least an hour .
had one piece of the white pizza , and threw the rest of the $ 17.00 in the trash , unfortunately i had taken this to go and did n't want to make the trip back i was so disgusted . maybe the normal pizzas are ok .
they never showed up for the appointment and finally called an hour after the appointment time . they claimed that they knocked on the door - nope . after reading the reviews below , however , i 'm kind of glad that they did n't come .
only have seating for 2 parties of 8 or larger . avoid this restaurant if you have a large group . they do not have reservations or call ahead seating . very disappointed !
went for the fish and chips and fried shrimp . awful- literally tasted like the frozen fish entrees we could buy from harris teeter .
i would avoid them like the plague . they dont deliver what they promise and its impossible to get any satisfaction from complaints .
roadside assistance from my insurance company , found the worst company ever . i wish yelp would allow me to give 0 stars . if they tell you 90 minutes , plan on doubling the time and dealing with the rudest staff ever .
not happy with dinner at all ! egg drop soup was super thick like gravy . chips are stale . rice was hard , like it 's been sitting awhile . main entree was bad . service was horrible . not coming back here again .
i ordered the orange chicken lunch special today . literally nothing was good about it the orange chicken tasted like rubber the noddles has no flavor and my rice was undercooked never ordering from here again i suggest you guys do the same it 's was horrible .
i have to say we were very disappointed by this place . carpets were dirty and the place looks like it 's under construction in some parts . i 'll add pictures .
i would n't even give one star .
i love this restaurant but today it was the worst experience ever ! server was not nice at all and the food was horrible not to mention the service . a place i would never come back .
sorry , but i hate this place . they treat you like cattle , care nothing about quality and if you are not buying their high dollar package , they give you no help whatsoever . what a horrible experience .
good food , but literally the worst service i have ever gotten in my life . i 'm usually very understanding when i get back service , because i was a waitress . this time there was no exception !
terrible experience . my wife and i got diarrhea after eating here . i do not know how to complain about this . food was n't great either as i have tried a lot of indian food around .
why does this place have such good reviews ? upon sitting down at the sushi bar , we realized that none of the sushi chefs were japanese . now this is n't always bad , but it 's certainly a red flag .
literally worst service i 've ever received at a hotel . was using a conference room for multiple days and had to beg snooty staff to come refill waters and clean the room . also , policies like how much parking costs seem to change from visit to visit .
probably the worst buffet i 've been in , in a long time . food is not that great and it 's super expensive for what it is . safe to say i wo n't be coming here anymore .
yuk . not even one good dish . soggy eggrolls , watery soup , dry fried rice , general tso 's chicken was just fried with little taste . chow fun noodles clumped together . wanted this to be good so badly . charlotte really lacking good chinese food .
they did n't remove small stain on sweater even though owner promised me she would get it out . when i picked up sweater i wanted to look it over before paying but owner did n't want to let me .
terrible hours and way too small and therefore too busy . the opening hours are just ridiculous . ca n't wait for another gym to open in this area .
i 'll keep this simple . do n't subject yourself to this food . i should have trusted my instincts and walked out from the first greasy smell that i noticed when we walked in the door .
a friend referred me to this place when i asked if he knew any places to hear r & b and hip hop .
shuttle bus catastrophe . if you 've returned your car at the car rental center and traveling back to the airport via the shuttle bus , just hope that cheryl is not in charge of organizing the lines when you 're there .
the staff , especially the manager , i think her name is molly , is always rude . they talk about inappropriate things in front of guests . i was a manager before and i would never criticize my employees in front of others publicly .
not coming back here ! girl on phone was rude , i was overcharged , they forgot my ranch and messed up my order and their wings tasted horrible ! avoid at all costs !
if they had no stars , that would 've been more preferable . this school is one of the worst i have experienced ever .
i really hope i just caught this restaurant on a bad day . the food was bland and tasteless , with hardly any sauce in some of the wraps . and the noise level is atrocious . avoid .
i had really avoided this place but figured i would take a risk and consider it . i walked into the leasing office to get some help and arrived at the same time as a current resident who began to ask for repairs of basically everything in her apartment .
worst sonic i 've ever been to . i was in line for 15 mins and the girl even came out and served the person behind me . i ordered one thing and still had to wait an extra 5 mins once i got to the window .
well we 've been sitting here for over and hour with no drinks . would leave if it were n't a fight night and impossible to find a seat at another bar . the nachos we had were n't fully cooked with raw unmelted cheese underneath .
possibly the slowest processing of a sale that could be had . added bonus of listening to strong pressure tactics to make a sale to others as sad entertainment . we agreed to a price two hours ago and are still waiting to buy the damn car .
table for two on valentines day was right on top of another table for two . you could not say anything because they could hear everything . noting romantic about that . i asked for another table and they said no .
i would give a fucking zero worst fucking attitudes ever . ask them is they had any egg rolls and curses me off like what the fuck ! both shops are rude as fuck . fuck them never coming back
this has to be one of the worst texas roadhouse locations , and i 've been to quite a few ! the service was absolutely horrible , not to mention the facility was n't very clean ( see the photo of the shelf next to our table ) .
i would give 0 stars if possible . the man who did the inspection was very thorough then when we noticed problems with several of the items ( a c ) in particular they were not responsive and we ended up having to replace 2 a c units .
awful all around ! from the food to the decor , this restaurant was a huge disappointment . this restaurant is where lace , bows , and your grandmother 's floral wall paper goes to die . i should have turned around immediately after walking in the door .
worst service i 've ever had . this place has gone all down the drain after their gm quit . they place has super high turnover and the food is n't good anymore . the staff used to be great but this year it 's gone all to hell .
worst service ever ! 2 unfriendly hostess in front were talking to each other and we had to ask them to seat us . then it took 15 minutes to approach our table and that was after we asked for help . the food was ok .
came here with my wife , 10 tables were empty but with reserved signs . the hostess said that everything is busy and we need to sit in the back side . the back side was a small room cold .
not at all what i asked for . she kept assuring me my manicure was going to look like the picture i showed her , and that she knew how to do fading with gel polish .
most of the doctors offices in vegas are bad , but this place is really up there . this is the 4th time since january since i have been here .
do n't usually write terrible reviews but i just wanted a gift card and they made me wait behind ten other ppl .
this russian owner is very rude to me and whenever i call her , before i ask for the service , she says there is nobody for me around my neighborhood . she has no politeness to a customer at all .
had a craving at 6 in the evening today and when i went through the drive thru they only had 2 varieties of munchkins . the lady through the speaker justified the lack of variety with : because it 's so late in the day '' .
worse lunch ever . just went to pick up a shrimp burrito bowl for lunch and it was the worse ever ! it was freezing cold , things were n't mixed , there were like 4 shrimps and soo little lettuce .
i 've given up on this place after giving it many chances . strike 1 : black mold in my pasta salad . somehow they did n't have a system in place to throw out old pasta salad so there was lots of it .
was very excited to try this place was very disappointed . walked in and was told there would be a 10 minute wait being we did n't want to sit in the bar area .
honestly did n't have the pleasure to eat here . we sat down with a group of 16 ( coming from a competing trip ) , we saw the menu said no separate checks '' - so we asked .
prob the most unprofessional dog grooming business i 've ever dealt with . booked a first time appointment 3 weeks out for my 2 small dogs .
i ordered delivery and it was a mistake . my soup came in a sandwich like to go container , luckily i had something i could transfer it into to eat . the sandwich i ordered was supposed to come with bacon instead i got ham .
this is a poorly managed kfc , it never fails . something is always wrong or out ! tonight the manager told us she was out of hot sauce and to come back tomorrow ! what ! i ordered cole slaw , got just add water mashed potatoes !
wow . call to order take out or pick up as indicated on yelp and i 'm told they are too busy to take my order ( unheard of for a thai restaurant to turn people away ) .
thought the mini golf would be remodeled with the new owners . well new turf and a few rocks is all that has changed since the 80 's .
the single worst hair '' experience of my life . it will be years before my hair is normal again . if you are blonde , stay away fro this salon ! the owner will fry your hair off your head !
out of towners here . spent the night nearby and my wife loved other noodles and company . the staff was very friendly . however my food was really not good .
went there to cancel my membership and was rudely told i had to go to the location i signed up at in order to cancel it .
hostess is not friendly at all . i counted 6 open table ( and that 's just what i could see ) and she told me it was a 5-10 minute wait . a couple came after me and the hostess did n't even acknowledge them .
the walgreens itself is n't bad at all but the pharmacy their staff is horrible . every single time i have gone to fill a prescription i have had issues and they do n't think to contact the patient and inform them of said issues .
the encounter i had with the man behind the counter today , was enough to make me never go back . whether to buy or sell . normally , i do not post reviews . although i am an avid review reader .
tasteless food for the high prices . the french onion soup was terrible . under broiled , watery taste , plain in every way . the burrito had no flavor too .
this place is legendary in the valley , and i have to say , i have no idea why . i went there expecting to see things like cod and halibut on the menu , like a real fish & chips joint .
i tried humble lion again last week to give it a second chance . i ordered an espresso macchiato and my boyfriend had another americano in store . the macchiato was so sour i could not even finish the drink .
our family has been coming here many years . the owner , mai with glasses had mess up our hairs many times so we always request brandy or tina . today , my sister from out of town in and needed a hair cut .
i 'm lost for words for how embarrassing this place is , please see doug s. review . this place stinks .
we had a procedure that was to be covered with insurance but afterward said was not covered ; then , became ruthless in collecting the balance admitting to no fault . complete bait and switch and very dishonest , in my opinion .
bad , bad , bad food was horrible . they have one chef and he called out sick so all they had was soup and appetizers . oh and if your not asian do n't go here .
terrible food ! service was a joke ! paid $ 14 for a piece of chicken you would buy from sam 's club bulk frozen section . do not waste your money or your time ! this place will be out of business guaranteed !
i would give this place zero stars if i could . the fact that dealing with this company was the only stressful part of my move is upsetting . employees were overly rude , inconsiderate and unprofessional .
i ordered a extra meat philly cheese steak what i got was less meat than i 've ever seen on any sandwich the bread was over toasted to the point of rock hard .
i do n't know why i went here the owner was trying to argue with me about how much i should pay for 2 tires beware they will try to scam you .
they only take cash , the menu is limited , and as far as the pizza goes -- you 'd be better off getting a frozen pizza from the grocery store and making it yourself . i 'm amazed that they 've managed to stay in business this long .
a great little neighborhood gym . what is supposed to be background music so loud that you ca n't even hear . if you are going to work out here , you 'll need heavy duty headphones .
be sure to count your change . they 'll also try ripping you off if they can . a nickel here , a quarter there . it must seem worth the risk of losing customers to pocket a few extra bucks a day .
the shirt was purchased by me for a bachelorette party . i provided exactly '' a matching shirt that showed what to write and it still wa still took 1.5 hours with a designer . ''
do n't bother coming here if you actually need priority mailing supplies . all three displays were near empty and the folks at the counter can only give you the i do n't know shrug '' . pointless to be even open .
very bad customer service . the server gave my to go order to somebody else and they claimed it is not their fault . the manager apparently do n't care and just blamed it on the other customer .
so this place is great if you want to get pills for all sorts of problems . when it comes down to being a doctor , they are the worst . miss diagnosed 3 times and let alone the prices for all their treatments .
we just had the worst chicken boti and tandoori chicken .
for my wedding we requested and had contracted a black stretch limo , that was suppose to roll out a red carpet and have just married on the back .
as in the past comments only gave one star because 0 is not an option . if your planning on dealing with this company please do n't !
this is the third time that we used online ordering and the second time the order was incorrect . ordered a hatch chile chicken burrito with double pintos . what i got was a chicken burrito with tons of rice , i really do n't like rice .
we used to come to curtis orchard sometimes . the $ 5 bag charge is n't the worst bit , it 's that you ca n't enter the orchard without one .
these guys are rip off 's ! will try and illegally tow you ! do not use them ! beware of this company
so gross . its always littered with loud mouthed teenagers , service is rude and slow and ive found hair in my food more than once .
zero stars . awful haircut awful customer service . i 'm not sure if they just do n't cut men 's hair or what but i can not possibly return .
the food was over priced and the portions was very small . i came in on a tuesday night with some friends . our waitress was very rude and was in a rush to get our drink orders .
my family used to frequent this location weekly . however the restaurant has been without proper management for a while . the salad bar is dirty and never stocked . i never see a manager walking the floor .
so frustrating , i had only 30 min break at work . came here to order a sub , and the cashier handed me the wrong sub . i paid for extra meat and was not even my sandwich . what a bad experience .
i asked for 4 shots of espresso , they gave me 2 and copped an attitude when i asked for 2 more . not a comfortable atmosphere from the baristas . i 'm glad this is n't my local stores
poor service - mediocre food - and we made our reservations at 1:00 to have our annual girls christmas party - and we 're not informed we would have to leave at 3:00 . not a pleasant experience
service is very slow and way more price than any other restaurant . you have to wait forever to get ur order finally arrived .
so i have an update and here it goes ! while i was driving home from work i passed this kfc and one of the workers was trying to cross the road without a cross walk .
just moved to the area , thought with it being a barber shop for men that it would e men cutting hair , that 's usually how that works right ?
what a disappointment . we really wanted to like this place because eat is our favorite restaurant to dine at and bring our friends to . the service at chow was terrible and the food was a train wreck , except for the mini corn muffins .
dont take your car here ! i pulled up a few weeks ago to get an estimate on some new tires , and as i got out of my car and heard rap music blasting from the shop .
it took around 15 minutes for a waiter to even greet us and introduce themselves . we were n't even told any personal favourites or specials .
went in for lunch with a coworker on a saturday . the place was packed and smelled amazing . i did n't mind the wait for our food ( take out ) until my first bite of the beef brisket on a bun .
ca n't complain about the food or smoothies . they are always delicious . but the service is horrible . they are always behind and slow . when i come in it takes about 10-15 minutes to make a smoothie .
i had lunch here for the first time today . the burger was exactly what i expected but the fries were pretty limp and had obviously been sitting for a while . unlike other wendy 's restaurants , at this location the drink dispenser is behind the counter '' .
if your looking for a biker bar then go here if not and most of us are not wanting that then go somewhere else the gm treats the staff like shit and is an asshole with terrible breath plus the owner sits at the bar and drinks .
i 've had better chinese food and the food here was very dry . i wo n't be coming back to this place so i strongly suggest avoid this place if you want really good chinese food .
i 've been to congee queen at its various locations in the gta . every time i 've went , the quality has been consistent . unfortunately , when i went with my family here on new years , my experience was absolutely terrible .
over charged on a blown fuse , waved new customer fee for diagnosis of 59.99 i should have just paid for that instead . then bought my own fuse . never again do n't use over priced .
i rarely crave jack in the box , but when i do , it 's usually after midnight when everyone else is closed .
be aware that this place will put additional charges on your bill and i will never return because of the shadiness of the charges . 1 . they charged me for 2 teas that we specifically declined when we were seated .
i ordered some flowers for my mom through canada flowers and this was the florist that was nearest to our place . i spent over $ 100 on the premium '' flower bouquet and saw that my mom got 6 lilies and a few purple flowers . awful !
called in to ask if she fixes zippers and she said yes . seemed like the place to go seeing as all the reviews were excellent . when i got there , no greeting , just a look of disdain .
i do n't know how they can stay in business . food was not good at all and the screwed up the order 3 different ways . spend your money elsewhere .
too expensive , for that food- change the menu , bring down the price and make some real mexican food- we want good mexican ! service bad - we went twice -- not going back until major changes occur ! many native mexicans around .
worst olive garden ever ! we got the buy one take one and they always give us the angel hair w meatballs for our buy one take one and the guy said he could n't .he could n't ?
waiter did not speak english the first time i went . he messed up a food allergy order . second time i tried again , waitress did not speak english . no one speaks english at this establishment . sushi is sub par .
their food is delicious . however , if you place an order for delivery expect to wait more than two hours just to be told the restaurant lost your ticket so did n't make it and no longer have a delivery driver for the night .
if you like cigarette smoke , stank bar carpet , and drunk drivers this is the place for you .
worst store on the planet dec 23 lines 8 deep and 2 registers . never again ! wholefoods
i had the worst experience at this location . first of all , its dec 1 , you have to have more than one teller in the window . people are paying their rent and bills on the first of the month .
stay away from this dealership , once they have sold you a car , it is near impossible to speak to anyone , if you have any questions .
disgusting . i cringed at the high chair they brought for my son enough that i had to hold him . it was covered in dried up food and sticky .
really was looking forward to something different and wonderful based on all the reviews . i was incredibly disappointed ! the service was horrible . understaffed , no knowledge of the menu , did n't check back with us , etc . the food - was mediocre at best .
i had been out gaming casino arizona indian bend . i needed gas on the way home . i put ampm into my gps and found this location .
went there for lunch , everything started out fine . the check came out around $ 30 and i gave the server $ 100 bill to pay for it .
do n't let the fake reviews fool you . this used to be the imperial palace , the biggest rat trap on the strip . not much has changed other than the paint on the walls .
the worst outback ever . rude hosts coupled with an incompetent manager . will not return to this location ever .
disappointed with the service . not totally impressed with the cutting either . had to drive other salon nearby to have my haircut fixed .
poor customer service . i called this store to ask if they had a particular curry paste in stock , the lady on the phone told me that they did .
so i got a groupon . super cheap oil change so why not . yea just do n't .
i bought two tickets for auburn vs alabama . i paid for auburn straight up and also with the line of 10 . not alabama . the idiot working who 's name is mike totally messed up my slip .
i contacted autonation about a used car they were advertising , a 2011 avalon , against my better judgement . i dealt with isabella johnson . loser . normal car stuff . price was too high .
why close at 7 if barbers begin to go home at 6:00 . waited for an hour and decided to leave . at 6:45 complete lack of professionalism from the barbers .
went in to grab some lunch after my haircut . there was only a few people at a couple tables . i stood there over 5 minutes waiting to be seated . no one came over or said anything to me . terrible service .
food is just awful . seating was pretty cramped . the service was good until they had to issue a refund . the worker doing the refund took the plate from my hand and angrily threw the food in the trash .
the bar area is nice but the food here was awful ! unless you 're just stopping in for a drink , keep going . there are so many places close by to get a delicious meal . this just definitely was not one of them .
they advertise that they 're open until 2:30 , i called at 2:05 with a to go order and they made some sorry excuse that the kitchen closes at 1:30 and restaurant at 2:30 . makes no sense .
ca n't keep an appointment . ca n't keep the rescheduled appointments either . this place should n't be called miami fades , no legit fades in sight at the place . staff also are terrible .
terrible service . i told them twice , i wanted my front tire moved to the rear because it was wearing faster than the rear tires . i got the other front tire replaced . they called two hours later saying they were done .
very nice service . the food was lacking big time ! i came here because of the bbq ribs pulled work all that yummy stuff and it was not what i expected . everything was very dry and chewy .
never coming back here again ! the older asian man there is just so rude ! horrible job he did ! no tip that 's for sure . do n't waste your time coming here !
oh dear what a shame must have changed hands new menu , much more expensive , favorite items have gone . husband 's burrito was tasteless and my crispy chicken was supposed to have fresh pineapple salsa but had nasty spicy red sauce too hot to taste .
despite the bad reviews this location is convenient to me . i was just getting an oil change so i figured what was the harm . i called to inquire on the price . lady on the phone was polite .
i am a young professional female who was looking to purchase a car . the sales team at this dealership was not helpful or accommodating in anyway . they would not negotiate at all , wasted my time and frankly were rude .
i would give them no stars if i could . my son and husband just came home with uneven hair . please do n't go here if you need a decent haircut . i could do a better job , which is n't saying much .
yeah . no , save yourself and drive around the corner to h20 poke or poke bowl across the street . my first complaint would have to be with the very small portion smh i 'm use to small portion with poke but this was just ridiculous .
i was there for lunch today . ordered my miso pork belly ramen . honestly , it was rather disappointing . i found the soup base a bit too thick n overly oily . i only finished half of the bowl .
zero stars , called and cancelled my appointment , was told i had a zero balance on my account . never received an invoice .
if i can rate or drive zero i would . no customer service knowledge , such attitude and yells at other drivers . omg really ! relax ! demands for 8 $ , learn manners ! next time i would rather pay taxi for a pleasant attitude !
horrible food ordered the kung pau chicken w o nuts and was served the cashew chicken without cashews . i asked about it because it had different vegetables and not peppers ( not spicy ) and was told it was the same thing . not .
this place is a joke . the service here is terrible . our server was a complete jerk . his name was geo , ( darker skinned guy with glasses ) he was one of the rudest servers i 've ever had in my life .
visited them the last weekend . wife had tacos . they were 16 $ for raw tacos and they tasted absolutely horrible . did n't have any taste or flavor . she somehow managed to eat one of them ; we took the second one home .
they left my dog sitting in his own feces for over 24 hours ! they have terrible customer service and neglected my dog while he was in their care . i would not recommend anyone to go here . they overcharge for their services .
i wish i could give this place no star so ordered a pizza cory told me it would be ready in 20 mins . i was there in 25 mins the pizza was n't even made .
i can not even begin to say how bad the service was . the service was so slow . the place had 5 servers and only 10 tables with customers . the server actually complained that they were swamped . none of his tables had more than 2 people .
the grave yard manager donna was not only unprofessional but arrogant and rude . she should n't be greeting guest with her horrible attitude . i would tell you to run the opposite way . poor customer service and no one could resolve an issue .
zero stars ! ordered a guinness got something else , ordered a salad , sat for 45 minutes never got my salad and left ! worst restaurant ever !
forgot my fries and then the manager argued with me about it in front of people ! wtf . you do n't deserve ten dollars an hour !
disappointing ! i was super excited to try this place as a healthy option near my house and what a let down it was ! ordered the ty cobb . avocado was rock hard and romaine was mostly yellow white and not green . probably wo n't be returning !
the panini wrap i got was very bland . my friend got a skinny '' sandwich and the bread was so thin it started falling apart after two bites .
i would give 0 stars if available . i got this deal from buytopia . promised a full shampoo of the interior yet none of the interior was shampooed . charles washed part of the car .
i was pleased the first time . i explained expecting the same groomer each visit and expressed that salons locally do n't seem to do that my mother did n't complain of their haircuts but of your attitude and condensing talk and her dogs aggressive behavior after leaving .
terrible company ! they do n't care about the person at all . we got screwed out of our dream home twice and it turned our home search into a nightmare ! if this review is n't enough to deter you , find out for yourself !
sadly we wasted our money and time at this so called festival . it all seem very disorganized . most of the food vendor did not have their food properly set up . several had their food out in the sun unwrapped with flies landing on the food .
i have loved this restaurant for years but the last two times have been beyond disappointing . it took almost ten minutes to get drink chips . the waitress only had appeared to have 4 tables to tend to but really slow .
the only reason i give them one star is because there is n't a lower rating . bought a can am commander from them because they were the only place i could get it .
tried to go here for brunch . waited in line over 30 minutes while no one was clearing the dirty tables . eventually we were told that they had run out of eggs . at a breakfast place . awesome . avoid it and go somewhere else .
worst experience ever ! very un organized and unprofessional . we planned a weekend getaway and were very dissatisfied with this company . after we met our host in the fist venue she gave us some excuse that the party bus had broken down .
this place is terrible . my appointment was at 9am at 10:15 am i finaly get called back now i have to start the waiting all over .
i ordered delivery from pizza nova last week . pizza sauce tasted like canned tomato paste . the dough was burnt . delivery was fast .
we waited 10 minutes before a waitress came to the hostess station and said sit wherever you want . i 'll get to you when i can . ''
absolutely terrible service ! let me start by saying i work in the medical field so i 'm not an idiot when it comes to services of medical offices .
i would give them zero stars if possible . all they do is bully you because they know there is no where else you can go for gas services .
while outside it is advertised as a 24 hour drive thru , i waited 15 minutes with no service .
never received dinner ! never going to return ! we had a reservation and were promptly seated at 5:45 . at 6:10 we interrupted a passing employee and asked if he could find the waiter assigned our table . at 6:20 we receive drinks and ordered dinner .
i know you 're supposed to get what you pay for but this is a whole new level . they actually used canned tuna in one of their rolls
this is the absolute worst restaurant i have ever been to . the service is the worst . the staff is very rude . i was there for dinner the day before thanksgiving with my family and had a very bad experience .
classic . walk in and not a single of the three men working at the front greet my sister and me . 10 seconds later , a man walks in and is greeted and asked if he needs help with anything .
the staff was nice but there services where very disappointing ! i paid $ 50 for the full service deluxe deal and had to tell them 3 times about issues about my car having dirt on it , windshield being dirty , and not vacuuming the floor carpet well .
purchased a wine fridge , they offered to pack it for us and have us pay for shipping separately . the wine fridge came completely damaged broken and unusable -- the packaging was literally just falling off . store took no responsibility and neither did the shipping company .
usually , i 've enjoyed this location but i 've had 3 consecutive trips that were horrible . when the employee making the smoothie is looking around and unsure of the ingredients then know it 's over .
the tacos had cheese wiz on it . pizza is raw . i never got the food i ordered and the drinks were watered down . i 'd say skip this place
went the first time cause i was told it 's the place to go after hours for drunk food . .well . you have to be drunk to be ok with getting food from here .
upon arrival for brunch this weekend we were met with quite indifference . we were asked for 30 minuted to seat a party of 6 and agreed . after 1 hour of waiting and checking in with the host , there was no sympathy or sense of urgency .
had n't been there in a while . wow , has it gone down hill . food was terrible . the soup was disgusting . both my sister and i could n't eat it . the entrees were cold and way too salty .
black hair in my wings and staff seemed either behind or they just hated their job . pan pizza was good but the hand tossed was mostly crust with no cheese or toppings . save your money and go somewhere else !
watch out they will rip you off . brought back with a full tank and still got a fuel charge . the car smelled like a garbage dump , really , like someone had left a bag of fruit sit in it for a week or two .
second time coming here since they renovated , and had horrible service both times . nobody seems to be in a hurry to take your order , and when they finally do , they do n't even bother writing it down .
i was there . i saw it all happen . it was awful . of course jason failed to mentioned that the location is prime as you will walk by the food court on the way out . hello fat burger .
i 've been to the south side location multiple times and received better service . we chose to sit outside and we waited 15 mins at least to get a glass of water and meet our waitress . very disappointed in the service at the north shore location .
i have been to the office for lunch a couple times . salads and stuff and it was okay . we just went for easter brunch today , and it was horrible .
i 'm no chef ramsey but disappointment from what i tried last night . i left the restaurant hungry . i really wanted to enjoy this experience but it was far from it . waiter was slow . he was acting confused from the very beginning .
tried sesame chicken lunch special - lets just say i am sorry i did - no redeeming value in rice eggroll or chicken . chicken rubbery - dark meat and battered heavy . rice had a few peas and carrots - no taste . live and learn .
horrible ! ordered something simple a patty melt ! dried out bread over cooked patty and 14 french fries , my guest ordered fish n chips all breading and few fries ( must be shortage if potatoes ) never go again over priced crap
i 'm a long time customer and i am appalled by the way they treated me during my most recent visit . i ordered a cappuccino and even tipped the barista .
omg i 'm just glad it 's not me the customer service is always terrible i really wish i could find another place close but with good chinese food ! again the food good but service is very very very very terrible
bought two new tires for my rv . paid for mounting and balancing only to find out they do not have the capability to balance rv tires . did not tell us and charged us anyway .
my wife & i picked this landscaping company to do our backyard . the owner who came out for the estimate was not punctual . the work that was done looks cheap and bad . needs to be partially redone ( will use a different company this time ) .
really awful . bad food , bad service , dirty tables , dirty restrooms . plus , they do n't take credit cards .
unfortunately , this company proved to be yet another who schedules an appointment and never shows up . i called and set up an appointment for an estimate for biweekly services . the gentlemen advised that his crew would be there between 7am and 9am on wednesday morning .
stay far far away from this place . services '' are sloppy and destructive and if you complain the manager will laugh and mock while telling you what a good manager she is before she starts trying to threaten you .
stay away . their pizza always comes undercooked and management is unwilling to do anything about it .
this place is disgustingly dirty . not just from customers but dirty ! area around cash register has dust that has been there for a long time . area to prepare coffee is nasty and needs a deep clean .
do not patronize this place yuck i ordered a couple slices and got day old reheated pizza . they apparently are not honest either because they charged full price for their happy hour draft . i will never go back !
stopped by there this morning , but it was temporarily not in service '' . was really looking forward to the french toast i read so much about . such a bummer !
absolutely horrible experience . after making a reservation over a month or two in advance , we showed up to check in . we checked in , got our keys , and began hauling our luggage for 4 people up to our room .
1st visit : took order home - donuts stale 2nd visit : entered store with intention to make sure donuts were fresh , but no counter person in sight ; rather friendly , loud conversation from back of store - waited for a bit and then left .
i never heard from anyone from sierra gold management . it 's quite sad , seeming as the corporate offices are located right behind this location . way to go sierra gold .
stay away ! this place has the slowest and worst service . i would rather go to the dmv then come back here .
went here to watch the asu game with my wife and daughter . after waiting 45 min which im not complaining about a table opened in the bar area which we sat down at .
can i give zero ? in the beginning of the wash cycle it stopped and would not restart . i lost $ 7 . there was no number or attendant to speak with . the only point of contact was an email that immediately bounced back .
we took our kids to this place to check it out . the place is disgustingly filthy .
i took a wool blazer there for cleaning and they chemically damaged it . there are holes all over . i did not notice until i took it out of the plastic sleeve to wear it so by then it was too late to do anything about it .
coffee was horrible . i got regular drop brewed coffee and it seriously sucked . worse than gas station coffee . ugh . now i know why the starbucks half a mile away is so busy .
took 15 minutes for a waitress to arrive after being sat at our table . waitress could not tell us what was on tap or provide a list of available beers . took another 15 minutes for our drinks to be served .
i have been sitting here for 15 min and no one has come over to take a drink or food order . i am watching the waitress chat and laugh ignoring customers .
do not move here ! apartments are falling apart , they are built cheap and bella sera wo n't fix anything . management is rude and lazy , i have nothing nice to say about this place .
tried this place about 2 months back and i got so sick . i ordered their beef bun kebob and it tied my bowels in knots for 3 days . i have no doubt that the meat was bad .
rude ! 1star customer service 5 stars food , went in tonight , ordered some take out , you have to practically shout your order because of that glass shield ! i had trouble hearing them asking me what i wanted on my food .
just saw on channel 13 news the gas pumps are stealing credit card information . make sure you pay inside .
do not work with this company ! real property management is so misleading in everything they tell you . they will say anything to get your business but none of it is true .
we came with a party of 4 and waited for 30 ' . there was no menu at our table for the next 10 ' . ordered matcha ice cream and oreo ice cream . not too impressive . there next day , 3 of us got diarrhea .
we arrived today at 11am and were told that the wait was 10mins . 30 mins later and we were finally seated . it 's been 40 mins now and we still do n't have any of our food .
call this pizza for getting yourself the best insult in the city .
wish i could give zero stars . could n't even tell you what the food is like - we were treated so rudely by the owner of the restaurant that we got up and left before even ordering anything .
worst meal i have ever have . simple lasagne . marinara was weird tasting . lied to about pasta being fresh . cheese tasted rancid .
company calls me nonstop after i 've requested to be removed from their list . sales associates are rude and call several times in a row on purpose .
absolutely terrible service . will never return . food is mediocre and the fact that service outweighs the beautiful views and atmosphere means we will never come back .
horrible airport in general . service is always bad and nothing flows as it should . i travel a lot for work and this probably ranks as one of the worst airports in north america .
i like the taste of their lobster roll , tastes great but its so expensive that i do n't think i want to come back : for $ 15 you get some lobster with a lot of mayo stuffed inside hotdog buns .
did n't even eat ! customer service was horrible . everything on the menu they were out of '' . waste of my time and gas to get there . they should 've just closed down until they moved to their new location ( wherever that will be ) .
went to drais pool party and had to be there before 2pm per the guestlist we were placed on .
tried this place again and see the same people coming in everyday . some ahead getting free boba drinks and half priced just because their friends work there . think thats pretty unfair that just because you have connections there you get free drinks everyday .
horrible service every time ( by the way just this qt location ) . at 11 pm tonight they said they where cleaning all of the tea machines and they would n't be ready for 2 hours .
it is my first time leaving a 1 star review ever . unfortunately , this post office is such an unprofessional place , that i have no other choice . they lost 3 packages of mine in less than 1 year .
i got a cut and colour from christopher . the colour came out ok , but he also gave me a beautiful lego haircut .
my wife has always refused to eat here , now i understand why . this could be the dirtiest place in town ! although the options appear to be healthy for the most part , i 'm very concerned about the cleanliness of this establishment .
saltiest pad thai of my life . just awful . wanted something less greasy than a burger , but should 've gotten a sandwich from tim horton 's .
bad service .
this place closed two weeks ago . felt i should leave this here before you left your hotel in search of flip flops at the fashion show mall . there is another flip flop store at mandalay bay place . good luck !
bread was day old , salad dressing was good but salad was over dressed . shrimp was nice size but tasted pre cooked , angel hair pasta was not drained well , no flavor and the lasagna was inedible .
this place is extremely slow , slow chefs , slow customer service , slow everything . the waiters are n't even that nice .
i am posting this , so everyone is aware of what can be found in you sub from firehouse subs . this partial piece of a zip tie was found in my ny steamer . unfortunately i did not notice it until i bit down and started to chew .
terrible store . terrible employees , terrible management and terrible advice when it 's not even asked for . wants to sign you up to help save you money but wo n't accept any . waste of my time and energy .
frankly the staff here is always rude . th toppings are plain and bland compared to burrito boyz .
really bad customer service ! they should hire people that are people friendly . the african american lady that took our order was not very approachable and did n't even say thank you or have a great day .
i reserved a space for today and their closed who closes on a thursday especially when their web site said their open ? i spent the next he finding another place driving around town !
i had been going to these guys for a while . they seemed to be very competent at first and so i kept going to them .
if i could give them less than one star i would . have been taking this vehicle there for many many years , made an appointment to drop it off the next day .
can not give a higher score . walked in to get my supplies when a man who almost rear ended my car jumped out of his then proceeded to go directly to the cashier . he started talking to he while she had a customer .
hands down has to the worst service a member of my family has received from a doctor and nurses and especially horrible office clerks . they are not giving service that should be provided .
worst food ! looks better than it taste . really bland . for southern style cooking there is no soul in it . portion size is ridiculous for the price .
at first i thought this was a good dr 's office but after i had a miscarriage and had to have surgery i was in a very bad place mentally .
been to this place about three times , liked it the first two times , but when my boyfriend and i came in there was a waitress at the front , we were waiting to get seated , it didnt look busy at all .
worst club ever . bull shit !
was told taking pictures of candy was a security risk .
my overall experience there was bad .
i purchased almost $ 1600 of parts from bell toyota . one of the parts i purchased an airbag sensor . when i went to return it with the receipt and it was still in its original packet , they only credited me 3 4 of the price .
in the master bath the pipe in the wall is pvc and was just connected with pvc putty to a metal shower head . we tried to put in a water pick , and found the shoddy work .
this is probably one of the worst experiences i have had at a restaurant . my husband and i came here to have dinner but due to the fact they have absolutely nothing to serve someone with a gluten allergy we had a drink and left .
i 'm not sure how far i will have to drive to keep from coming back to the bitchy lady behind this counter ( and her super gross nails ) , but it will be worth it .
most disappointing selection of food and gross not worth $ 20 take your money somewhere else
good food but lousy service . i had delivery delivered 4 times from this location before being told that i was exactly 2 houses outside their delivery area and that all previous deliveries had been mistakes '' .
the worst salon ever ! do not go here ! the sign states manicure pedicure $ 35 bucks . i asked for a gel polish change . total was $ 70.00 ! i couldnt believe what a total rip off !
this place is a far cry from the other embassy suites i 've been to . i would say its a 2 star hotel ( more like a motel 6 ) . like another review stated the carpet is damp and it just smells funny .
if i could give a 0 , i would . they lie to rope you in to signing up . then when you try to cancel they wo n't let you . this is the shadiest company .
i would n't even give them one star but that 's the only way i can give the bad review .
just had lunch there . i got the crispy chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries . the bill came up to $ 17 . probably the worst lunch i 've had in a while . the bacon was n't cooked properly and the pretzel bun was soggy .
i usually do not write negative reviews ; yet , in this instance i feel compelled to share my thoughts .
terrible service . food was way too over priced for the lack in quality . i had taken a uber there and even the uber driver was telling how bad the place was . i should have listen to him .
went for the first time last night , and let me tell you not impressed . they had a special event there staff could apparently not handle . waited over an hour for a chicken sandwich ! also was burnt and dry by the time it arrived .
i needed 40 corporate gift baskets so i thought why not deal locally and great coffee and treats is a great thing to get . only problem no one answers the telephone . ever . or even has voice mail . so i can not buy this from them
hey welcome to the most overrated mediocre mexican in nc . if you were anywhere else in the rest of the country this place would never survive . i ca n't member anything about my meal except being upset about being charged and not telling me .
pizza was - okay . as first time customers and knowing this was a pretty new establishment , i expected the employees there to be a little more helpful while ordering .
ordered a steak burrito that was pretty plain , skimped on the steak pieces but there was plenty of plain beans no taste at all , i can cook a better burrito than this joint , wo n't be returning to this place .
ridiculous is all i can say . very light day at the er . .5 1 2 hours and counting . waiting on an ultrasound for over and hour now . they did a chest x-ray by mistake . .my wife is here with severe stomach cramping .
bad food . the chicken quesadillas , tacos , and pretty much everything sucked . not much else to say .
food is okay . nothing special . waiter and waitress are okay . no attitude . but the system is bad . very unorganized or just all all-you-can-eat sushi tend to forget the orders . more than half of our order never came .
heads up people ! one of the delivery drivers at this location ( older gentleman ) tipped himself $ 4 on my card after i gave a cash tip ! pay cash or make sure to cross the tip line out so this does n't happen to you !
come here any day but monday for an amazing dive bar experience . do n't come here if your looking for fine wine and just so you know half the time they will have sold out of your favorite liquor .
horrible service , would give 0 stars if possible . we tried to use a groupon here and got yelled at because we did n't make a reservation and print the groupon .
3 words : do n't do it ! chicken is very , very dry . had to send it back to the kitchen . 2nd batch was better . but just the thought that they could have brought out the dry chicken to begin with !
the service '' department is really good at finding expensive things that , they say , need to be fixed . however , they were n't capable of correctly doing the work i brought it in for ( 30k mile service ) .
very disappointing . i used a living social coupon that was for a massage and a foot treatment . the firs thing the massage therapist told me was that if i wanted the foot treatment , the massage would be very rushed . hmmm .
worst experience ever ! i ca n't believe how awful this whole experience was . i purchased the groupon and she basically just used a brush to paint it on and was n't even paying attention .
i ordered a teriyaki bowl . the rice was under cooked , the vegatables over cooked , and the chicken was greasy . the customer service was cold and almost approaching rude .
it was so hot when we sat down at 8:30pm , we asked if there were problems with the ac . but it turns out the owner turned off the ac when he went home that night , 2 hours before they closed .
i 've been here about 5-6 times and very single time i come it 's either we ran out of wings or we ran out of michelada mix . the servers always have an attitude and are rude . the service is slow even when they are not busy .
the food is pretty good . but the service is the absolute worst . for the service alone i would give them 1 star . the food always takes very long to come at least 45 minutes for each order and its a buffet ; pretty ridiculous .
i would n't know what the food is like because we were ignored for 15 minutes and my 3 and 5 year old children were antsy , hungry and thirsty so we left . we went inside and sat at the counter .
avis just tried to give us an old impala that was in a wreck . now they say they do n't have any others left . we rented a new ford focus but they say that it is not clean .
terrible bait and switch decided to book a one day rental . made reservation online . got to location and told they did n't have my car size . told me i had to upgrade or wait to see if one gets returned .
very dissapointing . the food was bland and lacked any flavor . it felt like canned items thrown onto a plate . this is my first time writing a negative review , but i had to speak up .
what 's the point of having a sign in if they skip people ? on top of which they are slow and disorganized . do yourselves a favor , there 's another 3rd party on 43rd and glendale . they are professional , organized , and efficient .
first of all we had the worse service . it took them about 20 minutes to bring us our water . when the lady finally did my cup was dirty . the pho was okay . there was 4 adults and a baby .
went here with a few friends last night and now all of us have fraudulent charges . my one friend has over $ 200 in charges from them and only bought one drink , and i have $ 65 and also only had one drink . sketchy .
i ate here about 20 minutes ago and i already feel sick . they ran out of steak so the cook handed the line worker a shallow six pan of rare steak . it was completely pink in the center and not up too standards .
when i first was evaluating a new health insurance plan at the beginning of the year , health net looked like a good option . i even checked at their website to make sure my key doctors were in network ( platinum ppo plan ) and they were .
i went in to get some cupcakes but there were flies sitting all over the cakes and scones . i lost my appetite and left the place . they should at least have a plastic cover for all of the pastries like atlanta bread . it was disgusting .
1 ) radio way too loud . 2 ) service time is ridiculously long . plan for at least 20 min . wait after you order . 3 ) very overpriced for what it is . regardless of the gimmicky preparation , its still just ice cream .
overpriced . the ribs were not good at all , could n't tell if i was eating meat or fat . the pulled pork sandwich was low quality ad well . the fried mushrooms and fries would be the best part of the meal .
would not go here again . went on a groupon , still was n't worth it . the times square strip was supposed to come with a mushroom sauce with mushrooms and i had two canned mushrooms inside a sauce that tasted like it came from a lean cuisine .
horrible ! the staff consists of a bunch of hungover unprofessional children with no experience . do not go here . there are so many other places in the area . waste of time , waste of money .
this has to be one of the worst buffets in las vegas . i went for dinner a few weeks ago and paid $ 40 and the quality and variety of food was comparable to a circus circus $ 12 buffet .
i had been there several times and i thought the pizza was pretty good . it 's close to my house and convenient . however , one day i went in and ordered a pizza and salad to bring the girls at work and i paid for it .
i was very disappointed with new china . we got the curry chicken , beef with broccoli , and crab rangoons . all three items were very blah - we were not impressed in the slightest and could have easily made something much better at home .
we walked into this place because i read all of the raving reviews prior . we were looking for a new queen mattress for our guest bedroom .
they are idiots who dont know their own business and dont want to make money .
awful . someone walks into our room one night because the front desk assigned their keys to our room ! they did comp two nights of resort fees , but regardless , that is the worst thing that could happen at a hotel !
food , not so great . it 's always cold in there . and the owner is a half wit . in my opinion , it was way better when it was southside cheesesteak .
after i told these guys not to run my credit they ran it , i had my own financing and they knew it . i told them about 3 times not to run it .
first one star review i 've ever written , congrats elite ! i reserved a moving van about 60 days prior to my move , paid the $ 100 deposit , and about 30 days out had to cancel my move .
not good . the place has changed . we stopped in and the food was not good . the egg rolls were crispy outside mushy inside no flavor . my chicken had a sour taste . i asked them to take it back .
omg this place is the worst with customer service they are super rude on the phone yea i agree the pizza is really good but like seriously learn some manners and communication skills if ur here to run a business
good dry cleaning service but unfortunately they were no help when my $ 800 wallet went missing after i helped their woman employee try to find my order on the racks .
i agree , i wish i could give this place a zero or a negative rating . it sucked ! the bar tender refused to give me a cup of water and then told the other guy the same thing.
buyers beware buyers do not buy your dream home from richmond american homes . the sales person who promised us a dream home with their home care service person .
burger was over charred , too expensive and tasteless . it was definitely not worth the long wait and the price ( $ 15 for a combo ) .
i too like sub station 's food . but not when i get it from this particular store . it kinda makes my skin crawl .
never go to the shit hole . they always get the order wrong . to the store management , please hire some people that know how to take direction and follow orders .
horrible . i always find expired items . watch out for the cheeses ! super slow extremely inconsiderate cashiers
i 've been to this restaurant twice . both times the nachos were terrible ! the cheese was like chewing a rubber tire both times . the wait staff are not observant at all .
my son played spring football 2016 vegas chargers . hes 11 . team was poorly organized , coaches should never work with kids again . they did bull in the ring with a youth who had no pads on for punishment . team moms had very foul mouth .
terrible experience . my nails were not only the color i did n't want but the shape of my nails were no where near what i asked for . i even showed them a picture of what i wanted .
terrible service and mediocre food . we paid 40 dollars for 3 people at a fast food restaurant , that in and of it 's self should indicate that the food is half way decent . ice been to several johnny rockets before and never had this expierience .
i 've been here three times , in 2004 , 2007 and last week . the first two times were great , very nice stylists and i was happy with my cut . last week was awful- the stylist ( simon ) was brusque , rushed and condescending .
update and bad news : bedbugs ! i was all bitten after coming home . called them and they were very unapologetic , saying oh , there is bedbugs in all of montreal ! ''
me and my husband went in today for lunch . we ordered something that was about 18 dollars and my husband asked for some sauce . manager said it is going to be $ 5 for sauce . are you kidding ?
really disappointed in everything here .
wish i did n't have to even leave 1 star .
i hate to admit it but i watch the silly kardashian shows and was sort of excited to go in . these ladies are fashion icons so i thought they would at least have more clothes from their new line .
i should have probably trusted yelp and its 2 star assessment of this salon . but it was close to my house and open sunday morning . i needed to get my hair blown out for my baby shower and made an appointment a few days in advance .
service was terrible and the wings we ordered were n't good at all . not looking to go here if ever in the casino again .
i was starving on a sunday night , and everything else at ti was closed . so this place was my only option . the night before , i had a carrot cake from here .
sound academy is the worst venue in toronto . it 's a venue i 've avoided for the longest time until i heard that fall out boy was back and was playing a show there .
i have literally never dealt with a slower , more incompetent office in my entire life . if you 're trying to reach them by phone , be prepared to wait for 30+ minutes each call . and fyi they do n't tell you anything over the phone .
worst experience ever . equipment was not cleaned properly . they charged more than i normally pay at my regular place biagio and their service was no where close to as good . i do not recommend .
they cleaned a house for us and the microwave disappeared . they did not take responsibility for it . i would avoid them if you have choice otherwise you may end up victims of theft .
terrible place to get a bid on carpet . i had a 10am appointment sara calls at 10:30 and said she was tied up on last bid . which was fine she wanted a 11am which i was unable i actually had another bid at 11am .
dear jack in the box thank you so very much for the soggy non crunchy mc chicken tasting sandwich . you are so sweet for down grading your food . maybe you will mark down your prices with it too .
having been a regular customer my delivery was messed up . manager refused to rectify the order and blamed his inability on the other customers he had to attend to . ridiculously poor management and terrible customer service .
unfortunately this place appears to be closed now . number is disconnected and doors are locked .
food was bland . chicken was dry and flavorless , vegetables were overcooked and tasted strange . mashed potatoes were good . service lacked enthusiasm or any amount of interest in working for a bigger tip . he was nice enough , but had no energy .
i bought my house in 2014 with solar panels already on it . the sc lease was transferred to me . though i was contacted by a rep and got signed up for auto pay they continued to charge the old owner and not me fore 6 months !
this is for the food side . worst service ever ! and food was so bad , we did n't even eat it . we ordered our food , and it took close to an hour for it to come out . the food was overcooked and dry .
everything . literally everything is closed in this airport at 10 pm on a saturday night ! in vegas ? wth ? all restaurants and bars were closed . i thought vegas would be a good layover spot- wrong !
the place is nice and the service is nice as long as you do n't have your nails done by the owner . please know i do n't usually give bad reviews about anyone 's business and try to see the better good in things furthermore in people .
went in with an alteration on one shoulder of a shirt . when i came to pick up it looked loosely fixed so i took it back .
called them today to redeem a groupon and the person talked to me like i was a complete idiot . apparently the person who does groupons has n't been there in over a year , even though i purchased the one i have this month .
i waited over three hours for my sister to get a simple haircut and some bangs . i do not suggest you go here if you have other things to do in your day . the students are not encouraged to act or present themselves in a professional way .
i was extremely unimpressed with this aquarium . it seems much too small i feel bad for the sea life living there
earlier in the day i called to see when sports book is closed and i was told 10pm . i asked when was the last time i may place a bet the lady said 10pm .
my review is for the thai basil at paradise valley mall ( cactus at tatum ) and this is the worst asian food i 've had . when we walked in i saw someone 's dish and thought it looked bad - i would n't be ordering that .
went here last week with my brother , sister-in-law , and husband . we stopped by the mgm grand food court for breakfast and all settled on trying their breakfast burritos . worst decision ever !
can i give this place 0 stars ? i walked in and was ignored for a good 5 minutes , while the girls at the front desk were having personal conversations .
my husband & i came to this location a few days ago to have a full diagnostic done on our truck as it had a low idle and would stall out on red lights . they supposedly fixed the issue $ 400 later .
put in the wrong tire size into my car . would n't you expect them to know this stuff ?
it seems to be busy and while tables are full they hand us our glass liter of water and glasses . along with our plates and silverware .
modern and spacious facilities . but the service is really bad . purchased tickets online but they refused to issue me tickets because i did n't have my scene card or credit card with me .
this place is disgusting ! they never use gloves when preparing your food ! the women wash their hands and then slice the avocado in their bare hands ! how does this place have an a rating ?
we were sat close to the bar but tucked out of the way .
same experience as everyone else who did n't get a puppy . the communication was horrible , i was stood up twice . the first time she claimed the puppy we wanted was just adopted , the second and last time i never received a response .
we have n't ordered from here in a while but decided to try it today for lunch . there 's no other description other than it was disgusting . the steak was a soggy mess with brownish lettuce and no flavor at all .
the penn hills giant eagle is disgusting . i bought a chicken pot pie from their prepared foods . i brought it home an opened it to discover it was rotten . literally rotten on the bottom . it was a gelatinous mess . the smell made me gag .
did not prime walls , paint chipping , grossly overcharged me . sent a husband and wife team to my house to paint , unreal , the paint job is horrible and i am currently pursuing a lawsuit .
i ordered my food i was told i can not have my cup until my meal was ready to be served to me . i even checked with management and he told me the same thing . what a disgraceful way to take care of customers .
please avoid this place . my initial impression after trying to book on the phone was very skeptical . however , i was in a time crunch , and it was close to where i live . so i went . huge mistake .
i was very disappointed with my visit . the food and service were horrible . the penne rosa with chicken had to much salt . the cheesy bread that like garlic salt and italian seasoning . yuck . they need to hire new staff .
if i could give no stars i would . unreliable , unprofessional and rude pharmacist .
unfortunately , this is not a favorable review . i think a change of management or staff has occurred recently . i had a men 's sweater dry cleaned recently and it came back smelling like grandma 's perfume . '' sorry , no other way to describe .
by far the worst nail salon i have ever been to ! they could n't take off the gel manicure that i had correctly . then jason did a horrible job cutting , filing and painting my nails .
we are in 2017 . there are no charging stations in the wendy 's . what a bust . i love this place to do business at but what good does that do if i do n't have a place to charge my phone . i instantly left .
ill keep it simple . im very understanding i know theres various situations that happen when you fly but all ask for from a company 's personnel is empathy .
so disappointed . my husband ate here 20yrs ago and loved it . we 've been talking and talking about going back and now we are sorry we did . food was mediocre at best .
this is not the l & l food that you would get in hawaii . food had zero flavor . was looking forward to the gravy fries but was so disappointed that the fries were n't salted and also the gravy was bland .
c l o s e d signs are all down , store completely empty . no information posted other than for lease sign . website shutdown , facebook last updated 11 27 2013 .
the prices are extremely high , i went here tonight with my mom and i did n't even order anything because of the prices , ( $ 15 for a plate of pasta ? methinks not ! )
recent visit for happy hour disappointing . waited five minutes after joining friends already seated to be acknowledged by server , then ten more minutes before my beverage was delivered .
called and scheduled an appointment with albert for him to bid on my landscaping project . he did not show up to the appointment and did not bother to call . that was a month ago .
so far , my worst chinese food experience ever ! my mistake though , as i should have known better when i entered the restaurant . atrocious decor , no one to greet me , and only a couple eating there .
nice rugs , but their sales tactics are as sleazy as they come . repeatedly brought coffee and donuts on sales calls , and sent small presents in the mail to butter me up , before trying to rip me off .
prices still high even going out of business . as i was going in everyone was not holding any bags as they were walking out . had a 20 coupon that they emailed me off sale and clearance prices would not honor , expires april 23rd .
terrible school ! they call themselves christian '' certainly do not act like one . absolute worst curriculum and do not get you ready for college . all staff cherry pick , favoritism and unhelpful . students are the worst , bullies !
the pizza was like frozen boxed pizza and the chicken was old . i wanted to like this place because it is close to home and seemed like a good deal . it is a no deal kind of place . i do not recommend .
zero stars . heck , negative stars . they absolutely are horrific . i should 've known when i first set up service and it took 4 calls to even get that initiated that they were bad news .
this location has successfully not gotten my order right more times than i can count . glad another opened up down the street in chandler .
terrible experience . raise price in the middle & paid 350 for coloring which not even professionally done .
was excited to try a noodle house , but did not enjoy the experience . there was a dust film was over windows . dingy . dirty . unsanitary . ordered orange chicken egg drop soup .
gus pizza '' . or should i call it gross pizza '' . honestly , frozen pizza from grocery store had more flavors than their pizza ! i will make this short ! if you want to grab few drinks , sure !
wow . what an awful place . my family and i stay here before a long trip the following day , as we arrived and stayed in phoenix the night before .
we had a decent size party 8 adults and 4 kids . we arrived at 630 and waited an hour while other smaller parties were seated ahead of us instead of them putting tables together . we ordered drinks and app and were served pretty quickly .
my insurance carrier is a humana hmo and i am required to be referred to specialist . my referral was to the shepherd eye center for a glaucoma exam .
so i just paid this guy to come over here and pick up my $ 25 he did nothing to fix my lock .
ghetto ! the pictures are way different ! this area is very scary ! only stayed here because it was free stay but even if it was free i would not go again . way too far from the strip !
unbelievably bad customer service ! first , finding someone to assist is incredibly difficult . second , speaking with individual at checkout was like trying to speak with my 3 yr old .
do not go on veterans day ! they do not recognize the holiday ! rude !
limited fish and especially meat selection . to be fair it 's not meant to be a fine butcher shop but the website led me to believe there would be significantly more choice .
this is now the third time we 've been here to file our taxes . the first visit was fine although we did feel like we were being rushed even though we had an appointment and they did n't see us on time . the second time was terrible .
what is going on here ? kebab 49 is really only a hole in the wall , mall restaurant , serving mediocre food , and they charge champagne prices .
it would be a zero star if it was just for me ! i went back tonight with an appointment .
horrible customer service ! worked with many people in the office . could not get them to answer my questions always had to call me back and never did . i had to call them multiple times for an answers .
i went to china poblano with my family at 10:00 pm on a saturday night . we were seated promptly . our waiter was terrible . he did n't explain the menu and was not helpful at all .
wow was i disappointed . service was probably as slow as slow gets . unorganized and very loud . my impression is that of an upscale diner wan na be . over priced , very slow service and mediocre food .
part of my complaint is not ihop 's fault , but part it . i asked for bacon crispy and it came out half raw . they forgot to bring my toast and forgot to bring utensils to eat with .
we rented a snow machine for an event at our school . the promise was made that the mixture would last 2 hours on high . unfortunately , the machine lasted only 40 minutes , and then ran out of mixture .
i probably should have written this a year ago when we tried out this restaurant . i ordered their beer battered fish and chips ; the menu said they were the best . i never got the fish and chips .
got totally screwed by this place asst .
horrible food . the french dip was cold & they forgot the onions , which was probably for the best . fries were luke warm & by the time i got to eat them , they were also cold .
i was in town and read some good reviews so thought i 'd try it out . ordered a newer item the poutine . their version has fries , pork , pork gravy , green onions and sprinkled with lettuce . i was pretty pumped until it showed up .
disappointed . i order a fried chicken dinner thinking it would be succulent and decadent . the chicken was rubbery , crust greasy . the black eye peas were okay but bland , and i got about 4 leaves of greens on the plate .
ordered two sweet pepper cheese steaks and cheese fries to two to split . first , the lack of knowledge of the menu by the counter person was staggering . nice enough person , but basically she knew jack about the menu .
they will rip you off ! we paid our bill in full . eight months later they sent us to collections because they said we missed 50 dollars . well we did pay . why did you never send another bill before you sent us to collections ?
1.50 for a single little dried chicken wing 1.00 for a tiny little dried shrimp i leave with a little dried wallet and still an empty stomach just go to mcdonalds , man
only one thing : you get what you pay for . every time i come here they always make the cut uneven . even after i tell them , they make it worse and even more uneven . especially the blonde barber that works there : horrible .
expensive and slow service . you 're better off eating fast food or grab a snack and eat outside if you can wait . even by airport standard this was low !
i love close to this walmart but i never go inside . the few times i 've had to use this walmart , i 've had a horrible experience ! it 's dirty , ghetto and there 's no selection . it 's unorganized and messy .
i 've never been to a place so dang bland ! i actually went to this place on a whim before i had read any of the yelp reviews and was surprised that my experience was pretty much like others had noted .
there was n't an option for negative stars . do not use bishop & sons . after paying $ 600 and many many unsuccessful attempts at fixing my ge profile refrigerator . he was stumped and returned my old parts and refunded the money .
they told me they could n't make oreo shakes here . i 've never been to a dairy queen that has said this . you put milk , oreos , and vanilla ice cream . then blend .
do not bother going to this panda express ! besides being rude beyond belief i have gone in 2 times in the last couple weeks and they never have the brown rice . once was even at opening time ! no apology just rude comments .
i usually do n't like to let my anger get the best of me . sometimes it does . this review is the result of anger . anger that has built up like molten lava . this review is the volcano .
too bad ! unprofessional . please , avoid . i totally agree with below comments . boycott arizona carpet upholstery & air duct cleaning . i have filled a complaint - you can also do the same .
the year was 2005 and it was my first time in vegas . i did n't know that much about vegas at that time . vegas . i thought , just like any place else . so i got sucker into going to one of those time share seminar .
understaffed , undertrained , about as bad as the rest of the monte carlo
awful , just awful ! all the food was bland and tasteless .
i came in to get a full set last minute because my usual place could n't get me in . i should 've waited because i walked out so disappointed . i had nail polish everywhere on my hands and my full set was crooked and uneven .
slow service , wait staff who clearly do n't want to be there , food was disgusting . would strongly suggest against going here .
the worst ihop i 've ever been to . half the restaurant was empty and we were told it was a 45 min wait . when we were seated it took 17 min for a server to come to us after i had to go ask for a server .
i had the worst experience here . from the moment we checked in , the room was still dirty , to the moment we checked out , waited 15 minutes for our car and it wasnt even busy !
this place is filthy ! the kitchen was visible when we visited the restroom , and it was really disgusting . the subway restrooms look cleaner than this kitchen . i was shocked it had gotten a pass by the health inspectors .
everything was good til i hurt my tooth biting into a bone that they left in the salmon ! i 'm pissed
whatever doctor was working last night at 3:30am on 3 6 17 . was a rude judgmental unhelpful individual . a big waste of time going there . my second bad experience here . i only went there out of lack of options .
this is by far the worst dd on the west side . i was glad to see it was near my house but after visiting multiple times i can not believe it is so bad .
i 'm a chinese that has been canada for five years , and this is the worst chinese restaurant i have ever seen so far . they have no ideas how to cook .
this place is a disgrace . you ca n't even get a glass of water . the family has their grandchildren come after school , so its pretty much a daycare .
we were a group of 12 people who got there at 11:10 pm friday night , surprisingly we got denied to be served with given reason of kitchen closes at 11:30 '' although it was 20 mins to 11:30 .
this is the worst hospital ever !
i actually went there tonight thinking it was going to be a great night of chinese food ( because of the high ratings ) but was very disappointed . the food was not good , the service was very cold . i would not recommend it .
it is awful store and carrier company . the everything is through out only if you gon na pay . do n't expect they gon na help you make you work better even good .
since this location has diesel fuel , we have come to it frequently . the snack selection at the market is very limited . we have had a terrible time with the car wash at this location .
i would give zero if possible . i played on sunday 2 22 and we quit after it took 3 hours to play 10 holes .
please , do n't ever stay here . long story short , and with all fairness in play . do you have any problems with the way your rooms are being charged to you ? guess what ?
bad service . was there last night ask fora manager that would not give me his name . he basically said he could n't help me and it was the cashiers decision . never going back to this smiths .
worst customer service by an indian hotel . do n't bother staying here .
terrible ! i got a full set and within a week almost every nail was lifting . the technician that did my nails could have cared less about what i wanted . it was more important for him to have a personal conversation with other technicians at the salon .
no stars , over an hour for my delivery ! so much for freaky fast ''
from the moment i arrived , i was unpleasantly surprised . this place is a small room crammed with machines , treadmills , and weights . trainer jo was unwilling to give me a price quote upfront and was rude and pushy .
customer service non existent ! i walked into the shop and did not get a single greeting from the three associates . i looked around at the extensions and clip ins for 10 minutes and was not offered any help at all .
arrived at this location at 8:45am . no one was there . called days ago & called your number as i was sitting in the parking lot looking at the hours of operation sign stating , opening at 8am . that 's ok .
want your problem fixed do n't call air command . you 'll be up sold and not have the problem addressed that you called them out for to begin with !
worst choice of venue ever . waited over 30 minutes for food and was n't even any good . also dropped in for bowling and was told that it was going to be 1 hr .
6 , i killed 6 fruit flies during my visit here . i was absolutely grossed out by it . everything was fine when we were seated , but then we placed our order , which included mimosas and shortly after those were brought the fruit flies started appearing .
this place was horrible . i 've heard so much about the barrio cafe in phoenix but this place ruined my saturday night dinner . margaritas are small and food was disgusting .
half the portions and double the price than in the states . not good
some simple words . there 's more flavour in a bag of doritos for a tenth of the price
terrible customer service . i spent a lot of money with them and had an issue one time where the good tasted like salt was spilled in the food . they accused us of just trying to get free food .
i pulled up to the drive thru speaker at 10:40 . nobody answered so i pulled up to the window . the cashier that opened the window said that they closed early . the sign for their business hours said they close at 11 .
terrible place ! called and put on hold for 8 long minutes , get there then wait 25 minutes for 6 wings and fries ! then it 's 1 $ for a small ranch ? and food was n't even good ! lady at counter and bad attitude
worst service ever ! my wine came out in a glass with lipstick all around it and when the server brought me a new one , she said hopefully , this is a little better '' ! wth ?
stopped in here after a day of sight seeing ( cleveland museum of art ) and before attending that night 's yankees v indians game . arrived just after they opened at 4:00 pm . went to wash up in the men 's room .
really wish i could rate this place better . i had high hopes going into this place , that quickly plummeted . we had to wait a while to be seated despite there being no wait . it took forever to get our drinks and our food .
would not recommend this clinic to anyone . they have no respect for other people 's time and are not time conscious at all . one of the doctors scratched the inside of my ear while trying to clean it , causing nonstop bleeding .
fyi . i did a delivery order . i ordered : pho tai : broth was okay but wtf happened to the noodles ? when i poured the soup into the noodles they did n't separate .
this review is about the company as a whole . they agreed to match the prices of cox which was over $ 100.00 less per month , that was back in october .
for food , skip it . dinner was a freaking bust . i ordered at 7:20 , i actually went down and placed the order . she said 35 mins for it to be delivered . after 50 mins , i called .
unfortunately , this place is going downhill . the staff is constantly changing and not for the better . talk about no personality . plus the prices just keep going up . $ 29 for a razor fade ? really ?
i love museums . very disappointed in this one . expensive for the value of the exhibits . the bulk of the exhibits are photographs and digital displays .
this is my first time here and i am seriously unimpressed . the services was unhelpful and the food was bland . the store was clean , that 's about the best thing . oh and i kinda liked the pickle
mimi is no longer at this shop , however her shop is just 1 block down . everyone that had talent at this salon is gone . only mimi and vy is worth my 60 minute drive .
the staff was completely disrespectful to us . they sent us out with a random player and then threatened to kick us off the course on hole 2 , with no refund , if we did n't split up our group .
terrible italian food . it 's shameful . i do n't know who can possibly enjoy dining in this restaurant . yuk . get the ragu ! my pop 's can eat anything . it 's , hey mikey , he likes it , so he likes it . ''
terrible service . the price of the menu did n't reflect the actual price , the man at the register told me the menu was old ! yet it was still in place taped to the counter ?
not worth going if you are not in the area . the server was speaking very lightly , barely hear her . they ran out of tapioca and the bulb is only available if you have a seat .
pink box has great donuts but this location is unreliable . we went in on sunday at 9am and were told they had no donuts that day . i 'm not a donut expert but i imagine sunday is a good day to make sure your stocked .
horrible customer service never again will i go in . walked in the girl i front of the counter on her cell phone ignore me for like 15 minutes or more .they had maybe 20 polishes out .
why tia rosa 's closed is the big question . the new restaurant is less than adequate . do n't ask what kind of margaritas they have or the type of tequila used because you will be told wells '' not a typo . food is sub par .
agree with all the negative reviews . sad to say but the grilled chicken sandwich is bad and management is even worse . the entire operation is a disaster . whoever hired these managers is not getting their money 's worth .
me and the mrs were looking for a place to kill some time while waiting to catch a plane home from az . so we figured we would look on yelp for a mall to stroll through .
burger was good , but the service is awful ! we sat down on memorial day ( monday ) and waited 1:00 for 3 burgers and a kids meal . really !
you want some food with your salt ? this place is hidden , cozy atmosphere , really polite staff , but ultimately we go for the food , right ? i tried the beef lamb gyro 2x . the meat was tasty , but overloaded on the salt .
i would not recommend this vet . our pet was misdiagnosed we ended up at an emergency vet . after walking through the event with the emergency vet , we found out the diagnosis was something that should have been caught in previous visits with ocotillo animal clinic .
update ! attorney general refunded my money . so happy i got my money back from these scam artists . do not buy from here !
note : i must say first that i find yelp to be fascinating . i 've had two of my reviews removed by yelp ; one a 5-star and one a 1-star . they were probably the most honest reviews i 'm capable of making .
i 've here tons of times per month for the last 6 mos . took my business to this location after a nearby mc d 's kept screwing up and giving me the wrong order entirely every time , including giving me diet soda .
well , you can see some of the changes to kings made by their new owners . first , they took out the country look to the store and threw some bold ( read ugly ) colored paint on the wall . so much for investing in the business .
understaffed . placed priority on the drive-through patrons & ignored people in line inside for a solid 10 minutes .
i asked an associate , '' where can i find a plastic pitcher for juice ? '' she told me , without properly showing me anything , it 's over there . '' exactly where is over there ?
terrible customer service . check expiry dates .
terrible service . my husband and i went there on a monday afternoon and the door was locked so we rang the bell . the man that came to the door was questioning what gun we were interested in and would not let us inside it was very odd .
my boyfriend and i were very excited to try this new place as we live in aurora and kept driving past it . staff is very pleasant . my boyfriend got the shrimp and fish taco . shrimp taco was good and flavorful however it was small .
terrible . most bland non greek tasting food ever . souvlaki was dry and rice and potatoes has a weird aftertaste . it did n't taste like there was any seasoning . i know greek food , i cook greek food . this was lazy garbage . never again .
we had a craving for sonic tonight . so when we got there i went to order my usual with extreme tots and they told me that they no longer could make them anymore . this should of been a sign to leave and order food from somewhere else .
i was incredibly disappointed by this race . it was false advertising at it 's finest .
dinner tonight at mississauga location . caesar salad mushy , tasted like anchovies . waiter laughed . gluten pasta surcharge . no warning . we eat here at least 3 times a month . no fresh pepper or cheese for salad .
never got to actually start service with them . every time i have called to start service , the receptionist has transferred me to 'customer service ' , which goes automatically to voice mail .
horrible courier service , try to find another alternative . ordered 1 item off amazon that was 2-day shipping and the package did n't even arrive . ontrac failed to update the tracking and so i ended up refunding my purchase altogether .
this place is probably the worst mexican place i 've been too . the prices were a little too high for food that was way below average . i ordered the pork carnitas which i ate a little and ended up sending it back .
worst service ever experienced ! very incompetent and rude staff for extremely average sushi . and not that cheap .
conveniently located at the airport , this place has a decent selection of drinks and food . however the service is horrible . they only have one waitress . do n't come here if you are hungry , you will not be fed
sooo over hyped . i believe their attempt at creative cuisine falls flat and is only an excuse to inflate prices . i feel like it should be a rule at any mexican restaurant that chips and salsa are free .
i went there to see about a tire that had a slow leak . the fellow informed me it would be $ 25 and firmly stated if i can repair it '' .
never see the same doctor twice . the staff used to be very professional but recently has became rude and disrespectful . i will finish up treatment but my younger son will go to another practice .
do n't eat here ! we always order from here up until my brother in law ordered his usual and had a big cockroach smashed into his food . watch out .
if a haircut place messes up a buzz , '' it 's a bad haircut place . received a very asymmetrical number 2 haircut , really disappointed .
the employee was very nice and helped me with my order .
there for 10 mins at the bar waiting for a drink and some appetisers , but no one seemed to be interested in serving us .
wow i 'm just confused after eating at the kabuki in vegas at town square . i assumed this one was just as mind blowing , amazing and delicious as vegas !
my home warranty sent out am pm plumbing . they rep said he would call me back after he was out and never did . i called them and spoke to the rudest person ever in customer service . she was the worst ever !
yikes - do n't go here with vegetarian friends . checked out the menu , saw a tasty looking veggie burger , and sat down . ordered a drink , and then found out they were out of veggie burgers .
does n't have a return policy . i bought a hookah and it sucked . i was going to return it but they are only nice to you when you want to buy .
heads up for mysterious charges ; while the drinks are phenomenal , i 'm not at all a fan of skimming from customers .
i really wanted to like this place . the beer choices and the casual menu was right up my alley . unfortunately the food was not .
terrible company . has had car in their shop for almost a month , and when we call they continuously have an excuse as to why the car is n't finished .
waited 15 mins to even get served after sitting down . the beef in my fajita looked like it was chewed by a dog before being put on my plate . guacamole was just crushed avocado . no apologies . terrible experience overall .
well . i will say firstly this was a very unique visit . it was the second most worst place i 've ever visited . why ? the food was brought out in all different orders and i was eating alone while my wife and others were watching me .
because of a health condition , i need to take an antibiotic before any dental work . apparently , this did not concern this office , as they never called in my prescription .
if i could give this place no stars i would ! a complete rip off and scam . went in for a simple cleaning using their $ 39 special . got the x-rays and then a 3 min examine by the dentist .
this used to be my go to salon for manis and pedis - until now . the woman , who is assumed is the manger owner did my manicure . she was a bit curt and rough , but i let it slide .
this place is horrible . the owner is rude and unprofessional . my brother was looking at the menu and he just kept asking if we were ready over and over again . food is waaaaaay overpriced .
this place is garbage staff is rude and the food was terrible the crab legs had a bad smell to them this is n't chinese food go to krazy buffet for good food or any where else garbage
stop calling me ! after i told you the first time that i am on the do not call list and you needed to take me off yours , i have received three more calls !
the plumber , who is also the owner , was sent out by our home warranty company . the only thing we needed him to do was snake the main sewer line . however , he did not have the correct tool to remove the cap .
i ate the breakfast buffet here last week since the other hilton restaurant was closed because it was getting a new roof . this place was very disappointing for breakfast .
this place looked great and has good reviews but i was not impressed with the final product . my sister and i used the groupon and we were excited to have some pampering time . we both got pedicures and they were so sloppy !
order two crepes ( strawberry banana & berry ) and 2 teas . order took about half hour ! the crepes were cold and thick as if they had been sitting around .
wow , i ca n't believe they deleted my review . i think they do n't want people to know how disgusting this place is . trust me people . they come off as nice but when you sign that lease and start living there .
i 've had a bad experience here . i 've expressed my concerns and dr. martha and her staff helped me get to the bottom of the issue .
office staff is deplorable . scheduler was on phone talking about her work schedule and kids ; kept me waiting then i was an inconvenient interruption to her call . will be finding another physician with competent staff
horrible customer service ! nicole & marina have no kind of patience . i was very upset the way i was treated , they did not follow up with me after i was constantly sending them emails to confirm the package deal i needed for a bachelorette .
rude customer service . go get some skills ! they yelled at me for requesting samples . and i waited over 20 minutes to pay for my froyo resulting in a grossly melted mess
this is by far the worst experience i 've ever had ! save yourself the time and money and go someplace else . i got a fill with arlene . she was so slow and not gentle .
if you are a coffee lover , do n't go here . although its quite true that the decor is really modern and nice inside , the coffee is terrible . i did n't try anything on the menu , but will never go back here again .
the services is just terrible . the sales person did helped me a lot but after i made the purchase .
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service . we had been there last year and it was pretty good but something has happened . it was n't busy at all and now we know why .
i really liked this pizza places stromboli , but when it comes to there pizza i just ca n't do it . it looks like it just came out of the freezer . do n't even get me started on how it tastes . it 's just awful .
gross food , dirty location , no salsa bar , and rude employees . need i say more ? all benefit is that they have a drive thru .
they discontinued having a social worker and organized trips . also social services are cut way back . better to go to surprise or peoria for aid .
i went there last friday before a hair appointment next door . asked for a manicure with regular polish . they got me right in , which was nice , and gave me to betty .
my three colleagues and i went there for lunch today before a meeting . the restaurant was half full . we ordered our food at 12:45 and told the server than we had to be gone by 1:30 . we did n't order anything crazy . burger and sandwiches .
went to this little place on groupon , not one person working sunday night could even smile . not even the bartender . she was frowning so hard it looked like a upside down smile .
awful customer service : i decided to see what nice clothing items this boutique offered and the customer service was awful ! the store was not even busy , yet no one even greeted me , no one asked of they could help !
i visited this place for the 1st time today . i got the gyro sandwich . the meat was dry , bland , and old . i had wanted to get the kabob sandwich but they kept saying how long it would take .
this place is also a bad place . i 'm so stupid for ever letting them so much as glance at my vehicle .
this place does mediocre nails but their scheduling is horrible ! this is my second time having them mess everything up with scheduling and it 's the worst because you need an appointment to get in .
this place is really lacking customer service and training . when issues were brought up to brenda the store manager she had nothing but excuses ( lack of training and financial software ) . she did n't want to listen to my issues but rather hear herself make excuses .
the worst summerlicious 2015 experience by far . i can say with 100 certainty that fred was not there and his waiters and chefs were not there either . dinner : famous crab & lobster bisque - the only reason for 1 5 rating .
i ordered the medium reece 's blizzard with extra reece 's . i have to say , it was probably the worst blizzard i have received ! how do you screw it up ? it was 99 vanilla ice cream and only 3 bites with reece 's !
stopped by this place yesterday all i will say is this is the first place i ever walked out of leaving all the food never ate it . did a taste test got up from the table and left .
very poor customer service . i purchased a product there and used a discount coupon .
what do you expect ? you 're a customer ? you 're an inconvenience . you get in the way of them doing their job . sound ironic ? is n't their job to prepare food and serve it to you ? no .
i would never have believed i would be saying this after seeing and loving zumanity , but ka was boring and i am very regretful at having spent a lot of money to see it .
i was very disappointed with the salesmanship at baja auto sales on decatur las vegas nv . i was trying to purchase a 2008 chevy avalanche today from this location .
i walked in with my husband for lunch a few days ago . i ca n't review the food because we never ordered , never sat down and saw nobody but the dishwasher . the restaurant was empty , and after 8 long minutes we left .
i was excited to check this place out . i needed to buy some ricotta , but i was on a budget . they said $ 10 a pound and i figured i needed 4-5 pounds .
terrible unprofessional staff . i could n't make an appointment without receiving attitude from the first receptionist i spoke with ( alexandra ) i believe was her name . she instructed that she could n't help me and was very rude .
think before you buy . dead flowers they give you . wedding was to be at 6:00 they were putting up the dead flowers at 6:00 in front of guests . really ? we did n't pay for that . coordinated ? no not really . big disappointment .
it takes 20 min to get service after being seated . and the 15 min more to get an incomplete drink order to your table .
the haircut that i received looked like either a blind women cut it or i did it myself . i was trying to save some time and money and now u know better .
this place was the best ! sadly , it was sold and has become wok n ' grill . i ate there once since the new owners took over and have not returned . the food is not the same !
as an update , i 'm still dealing with this even though i have filed a board of pharmacy complaint , reported this to my insurance company who paid for medication that was shorted and have been contacted by police .
we stopped in to grab dinner and chose noodles as we expected a shorter dining time than a full service restaurant . we ordered four items and were the only diners in the store .
just to let you know we close in 15 minutes and ca n't serve you '' . wow ! did n't know that closing at 8pm meant you say no to a customer at 7:45pm .
was feeling sleepy manager comes and tells me i have to leave as i was falling asleep . told him friend was restroom . so we hustled our way out . terrible . rude manager .
my family and i ate their yesterday and i tried 3 crayfish my mom had 1 and less than a few hours later i was vomiting almost to the point where i wanted to go to the hospital and my mother had sever stomach pains ! never again !
very disappointed with the service i received . two maids showed up late and where not very pleasant seemed as though they did n't want to be there or that they liked there job . well there cleaning showed just that .
called for the house special fried rice with chicken and shrimp and the bbq pork fried rice . both sucked . i could feel the crunch of msg on both . bbq pork had no flavor ( zero ) .
this outfit is like most = crooks who hope and pray you get a leak so they can really stick it to you . my water usage doubled in one month yet they said nothing , that is nothing but send me a bill that was double .
so me and the mr are knee deep in guest room remodeling . so tonight we were going to have bo kho ( beef stew , vietnamese style ) but i fell asleep and did n't get it started in time to eat at a decent hour .
this place just is n't for me . the menu stinks , the food is below par and its just so commercialized . i really used to like chilis , but they have lost their charm and they change their menu too much .
is there anything less than 1 star . the pizza never got here - ordered hours ago . called after the first hour and a half and was told 15 minutes . no pizza .
i came here after receiving a recommendation from a carpet cleaning company . when i entered the showroom i was not greeted well . i felt as though i was charged too much for the piece of carpet i purchased .
very disappointed in this office . been going to desert sun for over 3 years and have always had a good experience . brought our newborn daughter in for her first appointment , arrived 10 minutes early as instructed .
terrible service . completly ruined a simple hem job . about a week after i got my pants back , the hem popped out . i took the pants back to the store to try to get them fixed , but they refused to fix them .
most disappointing curry i 've ever had . i got the lamb curry and asked for extra spicy but instead they gave me what seemed like water with oil and pieces of meats .
burgers were definitely old . the cheese looked like it was sitting under the heat lamp for way too long . my colleague and i were returning from a business trip and this location happened to be right across from our gate .
the food is disappointing , even for americanized chinese food . i was n't expecting authentic chinese food , but when compared with other american-chinese food restaurants , this place is pricey and mediocre .
worst food ever a garden salad is iceberg lettuce with pickles and tomato gross ! waited an hour and a half for food club sub with ham not turkey never ever again subs are dry
this has got to be the worst mcdonalds in the country . my order has never been right in this location ever !
probably the worst italian food i 've had in years .
i did a transaction with them and they made so many mistakes . they tried charging me 3 to go to a real estate company that i did n't even use . that is pretty shady .
convenient care ? what a joke . i went online to check wait times and saw it was 22 minutes . i also saw that i could make an appointment so i signed up for an appointment an hour later .
please . .there are so many great nail salons . no need to put up with the poor attitude of these folks . poorly managed and not very clean .
if you order from here get it take out . it took them 2 hours to deliver my one pizza . my poor kids were starving and i did n't even get an apology . i kept calling and they kept saying it would come in 5 mins .
i really wanted to like this place but that was n't the case . cake was dense and heavy but my main complaint was the frosting . i ordered their basic chocolate cupcake , pumpkin , cherry vanilla and triple chocolate .
horrible to go service . manager did n't even bother to address the complaint . at least corporate paid attention and apologized for the extremely poor product . food is good , when properly packaged to go . does the manager give a hoot ?
one step above grocery sushi . nothing about this restaurant makes it stand out . nothing authentic . wo n't last much longer .
horrible ! their website said they were open on sunday . the sign on the door said they were open at 11 am . we got there at about 10:45 and waited in the front for them to open .
absolutely terrible . got ignored by the bar staff while they entertained friends , and then got poured the wrong beer . appetizer ( trio sampler ) looked like it sat under a hot light for a week , and tasted just as bad .
this is the worst starbucks drive thru i have ever been to . the wait time was 15 minutes in line with a total of 5 cars in the line .
we dropped in with some friends from out of town hoping to be able to play a game . the guy said we had to book an hour in advance online and would n't even let us play the game .
i went in pre-approved to purchase a vehicle here and when i got there the vehicle i wanted was in the finance process . we found another vehicle that i liked a lot and started talking with this one .
the food here is n't bad but the service is horrible . brenda could care less if your order is correct , out on time or any good . she put the order in wrong and then acted as if it was our fault .
i have used shutterfly for many years and it used to be a great site . everything i like about the site has changed .
i ordered online . i received an email confirmation . after waiting for 20 minutes past our delivery time i finally called . the manager ( caitlin ) said that she tried to call and received no answer so cancelled our order .
first and last time i stay here . we booked 4 suites and you would think they could provide courteous customer service . we asked to speak to a manger about the employee and he was just as rude . not very friendly to say the least .
i was the only customer , service good , the spaghetti sauce must of been out of a can plane as could be . meatballs hard no taste . the italian combo sub was like eating the sole of a shoe .
very disappointed ! went for the advertised sunday wing special price deal only to be told it was a dine in price only . that detail is not mentioned any where .
we went for our son , who had to write a paper on indian cuisine . my husband is most adventurous with food and will try most anything . he did eat about 1 2 of his . my son and i just took one bite .
oh how sad . my family wanted to use our restaurant.com certificate and we 're excited to try mcfadden 's . the menu sounded delish ! we ordered a yummy beer , an appetizer , soup and dinner .
i used to eat at this place a lot because i loved the all you can eat sushi . when i went recently i expected nothing less than amazing sushi but come to find out they raised the price and removed most of my favorite items from the menu .
if i can give negative stars i would . i have never been so disappointed in an establishment in my life . the food was alright . the service was horrible . not enough parking . had to ask multiple times for drink food boxes .
i would have given this zero stars ! i walked in today , i 've been there a few times before . the one woman who was working was taking money from the client ahead of me .
went for quick lunch . friday special is pick your own special and yet he tried to charge me full price for two shawarma . after i mentioned its a special he changed it to the correct price . ( buyer beware ! )
how many times does it take to remember an order ? i ordered a decaf iced latte , and handed my card to the employee .
been here 45 mins . .no food yet . think they need to get their act together in the kitchen . this is unacceptable . i hope they get this in order . .would love to have a great place like this in our neighborhood .
omg where do i begin . walked in the front door and the place smelled . too bad u ca n't take a picture of smell .
awful bartender and drinks ! we just left our sugar water drinks because they were so bad . what a disappointment .
it is soooo mexican . i have ever tried different mexican resturants and this one is the least one i like
racist place ! i got here at 12 noon on the dot no one greeted us but i still signed in . four people ahead of me so i did n't think it would take long for my son .
taco bell is better than this joint - it 's the worst mexican food i have ever eaten - i gave it two shots and the second time was more terrible than the first .
not open 24 hours . as it says on all the websites and status . a rude employee out on break told me closed dude . come back at 6am . horrible horrible representation by corporate wal mart .
every other time we go here , the orders are wrong . what is so hard in making a pizza bagel ? if we wanted anything else on it , we 'd request it . then we get home , one bagel has hardly any sauce or cheese .
worst usps in town , lost my package and they are impossible to get in contact with ! i called for 1 straight week trying to get information about my missing package and got the run around even by the supervisors !
would classify as hangover food and nothing special . expensive and not delicious . located in the opening of a big , smoky casino . nice stop on the strip if you want to waste money on not so delicious food and just looking to eat anything .
this place should be closed down ! in 2010 they made a crown for my tooth that fell off 4 times ! it is still not correct but my insurance will not pay for another one until 5 years is up . now here 's the kicker .
i wish i could give these stuck up snobs a -10 ! they are extremely rude and obnoxious . i will never shop here again and i let everyone know how they treat their customers . apparently good customer service comes to the pink poodle to die !
two coworkers and i ordered from here and as we were eating we found a worm in the beef and broccoli . the most nasty thing i 've ever experienced .
second flight this week over 3 hours delayed because they have no crew ! very little transparency and just keeps getting more and more delayed . this is why i almost always fly southwest . luv southwest !
worst applebees experience ive ever had . we came on a busy friday night , and as soon as me and my two friends walked in , we were stared at by everyone .
tried to go here twice , both on friday nights . they were closed at 9:00 on one friday night .
had the car washed here today . what a waste of time and money ! smeared streaks on hood , roof , trunk and windows when it was ready to go . that is the last time i will give them my business .
it smells funny when you walk in . they had a 10 year old taking our order . i personally did not enjoy any of the food items but it could possibly be just a personal preference .
terrible tacos . soft taco stuck to wrapper so it tore when trying to pick it up . chicken and steak had no flavor . putting shredded cheese on chips doe not make nachos . would have been better if cheese as melted .
bought a scale which was far from accurate . when i went to return it , it said it is just like that , whether i like it or not .
i have a problem with the title on the car i purchased from cadillac and i 've called them many many many times to get the problem solved . each person i talk to passes the problem on to a sales manager .
the only praise about this hotel is the airport parking and shuttle service . we stayed the night at the hotel prior to our flight . the customer service was fine , but we also knew not to have high expectations .
no flavors in their burgers & fries , i do n't know how anyone that loves burgers eat here , i may try another location but after this i 'm not too sure .
horrible experience ! the cashier was talking and texting while being on the register and took her sweet time to help the other cashier that was actually doing her job !
would not return to this place at all . warm drinks did n't taste like anything and the crepe was very overdone . nice place but the food was below mediocre .
i will agree this is not the best dealership around , i moved from out of state and needed assistance with the end of the lease and purchasing it .
awful . worst bar food i 've had in years . fries were weak , sort if spongy . onion rings were unrecognizable oil carriers . zipp burger was nothing like description , paltry on the tartar sauce .
this place is horrible . they ripped me off so bad on an oil change and filter service . they left the old filter in there and just said they swapped it out . how can you trust a mechanic like this ? stay away .
these guys sell stolen scooters . their inventory is very questionable . questions are answered on the shady side . stay away .
i came in with knee pain that i 've been having for months . doc moved my entire leg around , did not touch my actual knee once . he gave me a prescription for ibuprofen and and a prescription for an x-ray in 1 month .
cmc main ; worst ob floor ever ! we felt like the recovery room they put us in was a closet with an industrial roof view : ( and the nurses did n't seem to know anything and were rude most of the time !
mex food lunch craving . was satisfying , would suggest sticking to tacos as my enchiladas were less then undesirable . heavy salt in beans . ended up only eating a taco and it cost me $ 9 .
so i decided to give this place a try since my nail lady was off and i really needed my nails done that day , i could give this place zero stars i would . this place is trash .
i have visited with this store many times . what i have been promised in contracts has never happened . and if you are not looking for a phone that gives the sales people a big commission , be prepared to be ignored .
closed ! i used this place for a year and a half . they were always great . i bought a new package on july 22 and was only able to use one .
awful . good food poisoning .
i just order from uber it 20 minutes ago cancel order even do n't explain why bad customer service
not a fan . better options elsewhere and pricier than other self serve yogurt places . weird flavors and the yogurt taste synthetic . i noticed they use stevia in some of the flavors and i ca n't stand that stuff .
very rude waitress . she was n't helpful and acted like we were a hassle in a dead restaurant . we walked out . definitely not worth paying $ 18 for a plate with that kind of service .
read all of the other reviews on this company in the other yelp posting . stay away from this company !
walked in and walked out . stood at the hostess podium for about 10 15 minutes on a monday afternoon . not very busy , but was not greeted or acknowledge . waitresses walked by and ignored us .
wings were fatty , fries were undercooked , and the hot sauce on the wings had an overpowering vinegar taste . the staff was nice and wed night is .40 wings , but that 's all it really had going for it .
we placed our order at cafe verde , 40 minutes later we called to check on our order status and found to our surprise that our order was canceled ! why ? apparently we 're not within delivery distance '' .
my wife and i frequent the vegas strip ( mlife only ! ) restaurants often . our concierge recommended this restaurant , as a trip to vegas is n't complete until we dine at a fine dining establishment before departing .
seriously watched employee in kitchen rubbing his nose and eating . never washed his hands as he prepared food , food was fair , after seeing kitchen in action , really lost my appetite . says grand opening , i wo n't be back
nice facilities - no issues there . however i was mislead into signing a 26 month contract when i was assured it was a 1 year contract . i should have read the contract but i foolishly trusted the representative that signed me up .
i will never go back eating there . burritos were so so , not tasteful . food made me sick . we both had a food poisoning . maybe food was not so fresh ? i am very disappointed .
i work at a business down the street from this business so i thought i would check it out to see if it could become a regular lunch spot for me . called in my order to try to save time and make it a quick pick up .
if you choose to play at polar ice peoria , be prepared for constant schedule changing and of course without notice .
this place was disgusting ! first of all , it took me 15 minutes to order because the manager ( assuming that 's the guy that 's wearing a black button up ) just kept walking back and forth the front counter while there were consumers waiting for him .
one star for ambiance and good service , but that 's about it . you definitely pay a premium for it . $ 26 for a risotto that was tiny , undercooked , watery .
tasteless , overlooked burger for $ 6 ! last trip to tis place .
i went there twice , the poutine was tasteless , the schnitzel was greasy and disgusting . i would n't eat there again even if they offered me money .
we first went to 3 brewers in montreal - loved it . the service was great , fast , with a fun atmosphere . we tried out the newer location that opened up at east beaver creek in richmond hill and this will be our third and last visit .
ordered a burger cooked medium well . burger came medium if it was cooked that much . made server aware of it but said we did n't want another one . burger had no taste .
their online betting is a joke . today was the 7th time i 've had to call about it making a mistake .
very upset by the fact there is no hot water in showers since last week . more upset at the treatment i received by staff and management .
i went for an oil change the other day and dealt with a guy named chris he was gross they dont practice hygiene ! and the whole while this creep is trying to flirt with me ! gross ! not to mention they totally ripped me off !
i have never seen more drama in a place such as suite one salon . as i was sitting waiting for my appointment with my husband .
poor customer service .
long wait , always understaffed , over priced in the store food items , and i got a car wash for $ 9 and it did n't clean my car well at all . i 've been to way better automatic car washes .
avoid this place at all costs , there are enough other subway resturants to eat at . the last two times i went here the employees were mean and act like they dont want to help anyone . rude .
the food i ordered was ok but the customer service was horrible . the young man taking my order was rude and had no personality . he did n't say hi or even greet me . the lady making my sandwich said hi and was more friendly .
tried working with the manager . said they would refund me if i took my review down , i said no i 'd update it if they gave me the refund but no i would n't remove it .
one star for the great view . i was overcharged $ 80 for 3 beers and 2 well drinks . insane . will never return . if you choose to go - bring cash ! learned my lesson . also the crowd is a bizarre mix of pretentious kids .
i thought the dishes here were flavorless and almost everything was prepared differently than every other thai restaurant i have been to anywhere , and not in a good way . go a block up the street to thai cuisine instead .
will never go back there again ! all they care about is how to suck more money from you . selling vaccines and shots . terrible .
had to wait more than 20 min for food while most employees were standing around . the drive through was at a stand still and no one knew what to do . awe full service at 3:00 on a week day
seriously , how can this place have 4 stars ? it 's the worst thai food i 've ever had . meat was over cooked and tough , noodles were dry , and veggies seemed gross and limp , like they used frozen .
i really really wanted to love this place . i went in today with family from out of town to celebrate my birthday . while the place is beautiful and the server was very nice , the food was not .
we used to love dickeys and would go all the time but then they started making changes to the ordering process . every time we go there now they forget part of our order .
extremely rude staff , very poor customer service . they need to remember the old adage , the customer is always right '' .
worst restaurant i have ever been to . it took an hour and a half to get one round of drinks ( 4 people ) and one appetizer . after 2 hours the food came .
this is the worst place to do business with . last week sat on hold for over an hour and now today 8 10 same thing . i think they may have 2 people answering phones .
love the hygienist . hate the dds and the rest of the staff . horrible chair side manners , only in it for the money
i love korean food and this was a poor excuse for it . i got bulgogi and it looked like it was done in a skillet with just some soy sauce . tasted plain and i did n't even finish it . never coming back : (
service started out okay , but after we were served it went down hill . no water refills and after asking twice for a fork and napkins we still never got them .
i write this as my oven is heating up for my frozen pizza . just got back from picking up my take out from avocado . 5 mins later , that shit went down the garbage chute ( hence the frozen pizza ) . this place sucks .
worst south indian restaurant i 've been to . they got our order wrong and charged us for items we did n't order . on top of that , the wait time to get simple indian food was atrocious . over an hour wait time !
rip off ! i had a speeding ticket that these scammers told me they could turn into a parking ticket and get the fine reduced quickly . well , it took months of hounding them only to have the fine increased by $ 100 !
i have tried to stay at the hotel two separate times . both on marathon weekend in the spring .
this is by far the worst chinese location i have ever been to , the employees they have are very rude and they do n't care about anything except when their time is to leave .
do n't fall for their calls of trade in your hyundai we can lower your payment . all that happened was i wasted three hours of my life got a headache and they told me they could increase my payment like $ 200 a month .
nothing special . of course it was cleaner than most ( being newer ) . but way overpriced for typical buffet food . my daughter and i gave it a try because it was new . if you have a tall kid , definitely go elsewhere .
absolutely worst experience i 've had with a tow company .
whatever these assholes quote you . double it . congrats , you got my money . but you 'll never see another penny . update : the home button was assembled wrong . so they lied about the price and the quality of the work is garbage .
will never pay for a service here again or recommend anyone . received a brazilian . came home to find out i not only still had wax all over me but also a ton of hair left !
my thoughts about this place usually start with hmmm . i am going to get some good healthy food ! '' and end with note to self : do n't go here again . ''
called to see if i could get my bill lowered . was told by the rep my speed would stay the same at a lower price . got home , lower price and speed 10x slower .
hour and half for an oil change , watching three guys stand around doing nothing . making appointments for an oil change ? this place is going down hill . go up to fletchers .

i loved pizza hut as a child . that ice cream bar . wow . is it the location ? probably . this place is just poop . the service , what the hut guys ?
this place looks to be a local gem and i was really looking forward to getting my grub on . sadly i did not get to experience it though because for some reason they decided not to follow their own posted hours .
are there fewer then one stars ? what an epic fail . i rent a car with the check engine light on . the agent lies to me and says he adjusted the gas cap and it should fix the light .
service over the phone with customer service was very slow seems like that the customer service agents have a lack of knowledge spent over an hour and a half on the phone to try to resolve my phone plan issue !
stay away ! my girlfriend just got back from the car wash and is very upset . she was up sold by the guy at the car wash and went for it to get the inside clean .
dont even bother to try . i have tried many korean places but havent seen worse service and food than this place . not recommended .
wait time is completely insane ! they have no chairs ! they stuck me several times trying to find a vein . im going to go somewhere else . when they prick you finger they dont offer a bandage .
the best part of our meal was the fruit fly i accidentally consumed while drinking my wine . second best was the cheddar smashed potatoes '' from a box . third was the steak . pictures and further comments available upon request .
i have come here before and have had really awesome experiences . however this time was different employees seem to care about entertaining themselves and taking care of the customer .
the girl who did me was the worst i ever had . she was horrible . when i was leaving i believe he was the owner took my money . i told him she was very bad , he did not say much just kind of shrugged .

for my first visit to the melting pot , i decided to go on my birthday with my husband , my parents and his parents . we were sat in a back room all by ourselves . literally we could have heard a pin drop .

i came here for a work mission . the lady at the front desk was so rude , it was actually awkward , i ca n't believe she works in customer service .
this place is so ridiculous ! always short staffed in the copy center . waiting 30 minutes in line to print 2 pieces of paper . unbelievable !
awful . i enjoy a drunken trip to denny 's every few years . microwaved bacon . really ? server handed me a plate roughly the temperature of the surface of the sun .
been there three times , the first there was plastic wrap in my burrito , today i waited 20 minutes for dessert . never going back . service has always been bad .
staff is rude and unhelpful . will drive to big box store from now on for hardware needs . i like to support small local businesses but i have had my limit with the attitudes here .
sub par food at a 5 star price . i was excited to eat here after i had read some good reviews of this steak house '' but was quickly disappointed .
this was a very disappointing dinner . we were really looking forward to a nice dinner in chinatown . my wife ordered white wine , got red ( advertised as auberge ) that was almost certainly homemade swill .
honestly , i ca n't say enough about this place . first of all , the owner is incredibly rude .
if you want to get the worst food poisoning ever imagined then i recommend this place in a heartbeat ! several days ago bought a family size poutine for takeout .
top 5 worst hair cuts ever . will never go back unless looking for a crooked very unwanted hitler looking mohawk
never been to jack in the box before but was craving a hamburger and in the location the young lady who took my order was very courteous and explained what came on my order . added fries and a drink the fries were so salty they were uneatable .
i was n't impressed at all . i was so excited to eat here since it 's been a while since i 've had filipino food . my husband and i went there for lunch before heading back home and the meat was tough .
this place is either a hit or a miss , with it routinely being the latter . the portions are small here and the restaurant is routinely dirty ( tables not cleaned , no silverware or tabasco bottles completely empty ) .
do not take your car there ! this is the worst mechanic in town ! they do not know what the hell they are doing ! i took my car there and now it runs worst than it ever did . they are not honest and will overcharge you !
if you know anything about paint or body , you already know more than the fools running the shops here .
a bunch of m f ers . the only thing they care about is how to rob you more .
this place is food taste good but they are extremely very expensive especially appetizers . this place is ripp off . they come up with their own price especially if you do n't order food from the menu .
jody should retire . i understand that she needs to ask people for id . but every single time ? and her service is horrible ! i have to walk up and ask for a cocktail otherwise she 'd ignore me .
this is one of the worst pizzas i 've ever tasted ! for starters the guy that answered the phone was rude , i should 've known then . the only plus is that the pizza arrived in good time .
i was very disappointed with the service . when the guy came to my house he gave me an estimate far above the coupon price .
i went in this bar and had a good time . i followed someone out and was stopped by the management . he told me i could n't exit at thus particular place .
i agree with everything that max a. said about this place . i went in here not too long ago as some friends really wanted to go for last call .
paid $ 1100 for the required course - party of 6 - and unfortunately did not come close to feeling satisfied in any regard - sorry guys - not a fan and way overpriced
waited over 4 hours tonight for delivery . after many phone calls we still did n't receive our order . they kept saying it 's on its way or just 5 more minutes . it 's completely unacceptable .
drive through took 45 minutes . cashier 's attitude was short . food was dry and did n't taste like what a burger should taste like . i have to borrow my wife 's thumb and give this place 3 thumbs down . never going back .
the only thing i had here that was decent was the calamari . other then that , my chicken was not cooked all the way , my pasta sauce was bland , and the waiter , sparky was his name , was terrible !
great location that is close to home but i will most likely never be going back to this place .
wanted unnecessary blood work ( every month ! ) , why when i 'm taking zero medication as they trying to fix '' the problem through herbal supplements 5 appointments and 4 months later nothing different . scam !
please be considerate on putting stickers on our car . it 's so hard to remove and it ruined my side window ! my only violation is parked the wrong way '' .
the customer service at this location is horrible ! i called and admitted to a mistake made by my 14 year old daughter in ordering a pizza . they admitted that the pizza had not been delivered to my home .
i went here instead of the medical supply i usually go to because it 's much closer to my home . wrong move . i received poor customer service and an unwilling attitude to help with insurance billing . i would not recommend this place .
i had the bbq rib and pulled pork combo . it was horrible . both items were swimming in bbq sauce . there were so much bbq sauce in the pulled bbq pork and ca n't taste anything else . service was awful .
it 's one star because there is no zero star option ! a greek salad with no feta cheese ! and a dressing that smells like fish oil ! what a waste of time and money ! never again .
i dropped the truck off sunday night , i did not get a call on monday that they have started working yet or what they found . reminder i had to schedule this appointment .
extremely disappointed in the service . i would not recommend this restaurant to even my worst enemy . the food was subpar . my friend took a bite of the lobster and immediately spit it out .
i do n't have insurance and wanted to find a deal for dental cleaning . i called them up and they told me they had a deal for $ 49 . they told me they were going to examine me first .
my boyfriend got me a piece from here for our anniversary . i love vintage and unique jewelry . when i opened the box , i was glad i worked on my surprised '' face .
this is a tacky taco trashy place . the burrito was terrible !
i 'm trying to think of a superlative i could possibly use here , and the only thing i could come up with is exceptionally mediocre . '' the good egg is n't doing anything exceptionally wrong , but they 're doing exactly nothing right .
waited ten minutes for a server to come and take our drink order . several staff member walked by but none for us .
got 3 orders of lamb tagine togo and not even one of three is good . lamb was smelling very bad like it was cooked may be 4 days back and the rice was kind of like spoiled or paste .
some of the worst customer service . they barely acknowledge at you unless they are barking at you for money . then you get your food only to see they smashed your burger . very disappointing .
worst walk in experience ever , do n't come ! dr. whatever his name is ( asian guy , tan skin ) , was so rude and gives clients attitude .
possibly the worst starbucks i have ever been too. manager speaks over costumer and has about zero knowledge of customer service . just saying if a customer asks do you have bagels ? the managers answer should not be we do not have a toaster '' .
lost my item and continues to lie about it . i would tell you to take your business elsewhere as they are the worst ! my shirt came back dirtier than how i left it with them .
i 'd been to one of a kind a couple of years ago . at the time , for the price , quality and portions , it 's a relatively inexpensive meal , with pretty good service .
june 1 , 2015 -- car stolen out of the amtrak parking lot . cops said another car was also attempted to be stolen . not secure .
horrible service very unprofessional . also really rough with how they treat their patients . my first time visiting , the man that put my needle in made a sexual joke towards me with another worker thinking i was n't listening . last time i go here .
was super eager to try this place but was pretty upset when the store closed 10 minutes prior to closing time . i 've worked food service before and we work until closing . this is unacceptable , and lazy . not sure if i 'll ever come back .
why do i try ? this place is the worst .
the worse customer service ever ! they didnt have burgers from kids menu . 30 later when the food started coming out they inform us of this and want to charge us for a full burger from adults menu instead
disgusting , never again will we return here for a hotel stay .
worst food ever . tacos were cold , meat tough and no flavor . and all that for $ 28.00 .
really disappointed went after the art crawl on friday night . they ran out of mussels by 8pm ? really ? that 's what they are famous for , at least what i have been told to try there .
i ordered the veggie egg rolls , general tso 's chicken , and crab rangoon . the super chunks of general tso chicken were too large and bad pieces of meat .
horrible customer service .
place sucks san diego , ca hotel is in logan heights if you know any part of san diego you would n't stay here but this place sucks and id say report them if you can
ugh , i feel so bad . me and this filiberto 's location used to have a good thing going on , but something has changed . for the worse . the only thing i can imagine is they have changed their bean supplier .
they refused to let my wheelchair bound mother use their washroom . thanks to the people working here she had to go home with poo covered pants . i will never use a goodlife gym .
always slow and always out of bagels . i usually go here saturday morning and by 9 they are out of at least three types of bagels . you are a bagel donut shop , how does this happen every weekend ? service is also slow .
this is for the vet clinic . do n't takeout pets , they advertise no office fee with shots . but there is no office exam except for listening to heartbeat and weighing them . i got no advice for my new kitten .
came with my kids and what a disappointment . this place used to have some of the dishes . i was sad not seeing the servers that used to work here , also the cooks are new as well .
so disappointing . i have not been this upset about poor food poor service before .
how does a fast food joint get four stars ? this is when i know not to take yelp seriously . this garbage is the epitome of , well garbage . gross !
went for lunch with 8 of us . we requested indoor seating . we were seated in a room with garage doors that opened up the west side of the room to the outside patio . we were bothered through the entire meal by pesky flies .
very understaffed with each customer taking approximately 10 minutes to be served we managed to clock up standing in line for over 1.5 hours . not sure why their systems are n't better when i basically did i most of the work online before joining the queue .
this is the absolute worst place to rent stay at ! they have people living there that actually do alot of the crime around las vegas . shows how much they care bout their establishment ! very disappointed .
the food tasted decent but was not fresh . even the ginger and wasabi was not fresh , and the miso soup tasted off . the server was a bit rude to us at the end and my girlfriend got food poisoning afterwards .
restrooms are for customers only means that you have to pay for all of your food before they allow you to use the restroom .
my husband had his wisdom teeth out and a crown done here . now that my daughter needs her wisdom teeth out , he recommended i call here . the receptionist was significantly less than receptive , despite my having two insurances and all the information on hand .
this place was on groupon , did n't even want to honor it . she was very rude and nasty . do yourself a favor and save time and hassle and go somewhere else . i would like to give negative stars
horrible service . they had 5 people standing around , and no one even approached me to see what i wanted after 10 minutes . got up and walked it as i can only imagine the care they would put into food if there front staff is this bad .
customer service rates a 0 . bar tender was extremely rude . just because my husband fell asleep at the bar she basically threw us out . he had a long day at work and was very tired .
i had to visit yelp to see if i could have been forewarned how the bubble tea is not good .
the store side is good but the pharmacy is the worst . poor attitudes and customer service from the techs . it 's almost as if they are annoyed that you 're making them work .
we contacted excel air home services to clean our our air ducts . upon arrival the technician '' insisted we had mold in our ducts . i paid with my american express .
i 've tried to refrain from speaking on this place but my gosh ! rent here is expensive enough for the area and for me to have to wait a week for maintenance is utterly ridiculous .
it has been a while since i was in but i wanted a radio installed . they install it but they did n't tell me the control on the steering wheel would n't work . they also must ave taken 4 hours to install it . not acceptable
this place is digusting ! the bathrooms are gross . the whole hotel is old and musty . bates hotel indeed ! their pictures are a false representation of what it really is . they need to renovate completely because nothing in this place is even remotely new .
worst restaurant i have been in toronto ! this place is really disgusting , poor service , disgusting food , dirty environment . after eating the chinese cold noodles '' which i think is their specialty , i felt uncomfortable the whole day .
eviction notice on the door closes them on july 13 2012 . must have been doing something wrong .
the food and service used to be good . waiter forgot the drinks , and then forgot to put in our food order . when we finally got the food , the orders were completely wrong .
if you are looking for consistency and customer service do not use . sadly , the only great thing about fit prep las vegas is the price . when the food is prepared correctly the quality is actually rather good as well .
the most disappointing aspect of the food was the lack of favor . fries are supposed to be : oh so bad for you , but taste so good . no such luck here . not greasy , not cold ; just flavorless and unappetizing .
confused . went in my my fiancé to get pedicures . when i asked how long for two they said no wait . we sat down and my fiancé was started right away and i sat their for 20 minutes .
rude and impatient . i will never buy a vehicle from this company because of the employees in this establishment .
i can not disagree with christina more , had both eyes done a month apart , same dr same experience , saw great same day , however 6 weeks later had emergency surgery for a detached retina that was never detected after being seen by 3 different drs there .
i saw dr. sarah ryan back in december . in my opinion she demonstrated a poor bedside manner , she seemed rushed , and i felt that she was n't concerned whatsoever with my comfort . i would n't recommend her .
i booked a deep tissue massage here and made it clear i needed a deep tissue . the massage therapist , ( although was very nice ) just did n't do a deep tissue .
good friday was ruined . tasteless , expensive and disgusting . fish and chips will never be purchased from here again . id rather go back to my usual north york spot than give my business to thieves of quality !
i 've only been to panera bread twice in my life . the first time i 'd only been in the united states a week . i ordered a chicken noodle soup , which was so bad i could n't finish it .
i 've been coming here for a few months and a new lady did my eyebrows today . not only was she chewing her gum with her mouth open but she was also was popping it all in my ear while threading my eyebrows .
waited 30 minutes in the drive thru today . was late back to work and the food was horrible . cold and overcooked . they offered me 10 off , which was nice , but good food and getting back to work on time would 've been better .
been here a few times -- and other than the proximity to the university there are very few if any redeeming aspects to this place in my opinion . the service is poor , the environment is dirty , and the hookah and food that they offer are overpriced .
i truly tried to look for something positive about this place but could n't find one thing . their parking garage ( which you have to pay for ) is reserved for valet and the parking spots they do have are reserved for i 'm not sure who .
this has to be one of the slowest mcdonald 's i 've been to , the parking lot is terrible and they 're slow as hell . been waiting for my breakfast for 15 mins now . terrible management .
the rating should be zero . the purpose of this company is speedy delivery not lying , cheating and not delivering , yesterday i organized a neighbour so the condo manager redirected a buzzer to go to her , however the buzz never arrived .
do not go here . whatever you do save your teeth the pain . from the beginning this dentist uses extremely fast practices where it seems like they overbook and then compensate by performing procedures in five minutes .
stay away ! lousy service , under staffed , waited 20 min to get the bill than another 10 to get out . chicken was burned , beer was expensive . plenty of choices in the area stay away !
great concept - poorly executed . i 've found that the food is either burnt , undercooked or in short supply .
so i have to wait because your potato wedges are n't done , but i have already told you there is n't any toilet paper in the bathroom .
i 'm sad to say i hated it , ate 2 sushi and little else . i ordered a chicken udon , a combo sushi and a specialty - they forgot one sushi , not that it mattered -- everything was essentially inedible .
this office is horrible when it comes to all around care . my 81 yo mom has had below par care from her hospital stay ( waited 24 hours for the cardiologist to read the results of a test ) to the doctors office wait time .
i came here once and will never go back . as others have already mentioned the staff are some of the rudest i 've ever experienced .
this location is awful . the staff is slow , rude and unprofessional . the lobby is dirty and it smells terrible . this location needs a thorough health inspection . i 'm disgusted and i 'll never be back .
horrible experience . bad dj did n't know how to transition from one song to the next . huge gaps between the music and he would n't stop talking the entire time . shut up . people wan na dance . one bar in the tiny little place .
the food is good when you taste it . but it makes me sick every time . it 's too greasy and something is weird about their injera , too much white flour
got a flat tire in front of the store . walked my bike in and requested a repair . the owner was sitting on the counter having a conversation , obviously not working .
so absolutely ridiculous . one teller . one on a saturday . 45 minutes and waiting to cash a check . every time . who still banks here ? if i ran my business this way i would be out of business
oh my goodness . i had a groupon so decided to try it . first of all they did not know how to process the groupon , after 20 minutes they tell me i will have to pay additional service fees on top of the groupon .
worst service . worst owner manager . treats her employees with so much disrespect and especially her customers .
the management company grey star is awful ! the office staff are un helpful and evasive ! the dishonesty cost my friend hundreds of dollars , she was told one thing and then hit with all kinds of fees that she paid rather than face poor credit !
i have been disappointed so many times at bricco , and i 'm so bummed because it 's such a convenient location for lunch . yesterday we thought we 'd give it one more chance ( even though we thought it had closed last month ) .
the girl maria at the front desk hates white people !
do n't ever move into this place . they have horrible customer service and gave me nothing but problems . it is might near impossible to get in contact with anyone in charge here . they do n't even follow the rules they write in their own lease .
hmmm . not impressed at all ! well , ok. their egg flower soup is decent . that 's all . service was ok at best . i ordered beef chow mein and pot stickers . my uncle ordered beef with broccoli .
ill premise this by saying i was incredibly optimistic about trying this place out ! i called to make an appointment . after being told i had an appointment in 30 minutes , i arrived .
absolutely terrible experience . we had a big group so i understand that large groups are tough for servers to manage but our server served half the table water and disappeared for half an hour .
food was god awful . the mole sauce tasted like they used powdered chocolate just tasted weird . my parents live close to the restaurant and i was craving mexican as i 'm from nyc and there is not much selection in terms of decent mexican .
the cooks kept staring at us through the kitchen window the entire time ! i found it very unsettling and it ruined my appetite . my wife was beyond pissed off .
this particular neighborhood walmart is a good location for me , however it is not my favorite place to shop . i always struggle with going to nicer supermarkets and paying the higher prices or going to this ( or any ) walmart and saving a little .
i walked in at 2 pm on a thursday . there were no customers in the shop , but they still turned me away because i did n't have an appointment . this is not a barber , it 's a salon for pretentious jerk .
we got beef and broccoli , bbq spare ribs , shrimp lo mien and sweet and sour chicken . i was very disappointed in the food for the cost of it . the meats were all soggy and they honestly did n't resemble meat .
i 've been an owner since 2002 , and have stayed at many of the locations . check-in today was meh . pros : great to stay near .
this place is terrible . i ordered traditional szechwan beef . instead it was flank steak , onions and peppers . add cheez whiz and a bun and it would have been a cheap philly cheese steak . awful .
dropped out of this school faster than a lead balloon . terrible experience . some will find it different though . i feel scarred for life because of it . yes it 's a great school , but not for me .
it is 10 minutes after the start time on our ticket and we just got let into the theater . hopefully the show makes up for it but right now there is now question why these tickets are sold on groupon .
our server was fabulous . unfortunately i can not say the same for the two cocktails my wife and i ordered . her margarita was undrinkable and my mango margarita tasted like sunny delight .
service was absolutely terrible . dirty looks every time i asked for somthing . the girl taking our order asked probably 5 times what our order was . i felt like i was not welcome in this store .
bad service . went in to get my screws fixed and they scratched my lens and they did n't want to fix it because they said they did n't do it . i do n't recommend going there .
ha , looks like i lied when i decided i was done with fuel . i tried to go there on this sunny sunday , emphasize tried . i even checked the hours online , ensuring that it was open . but lo and behold , it was closed .
i 've only eaten here once before . walking through town i saw it & thought i would see what they had . i decided to go with the steak hoagie , & some cheese sauce on the side .
absolutely horrid . uber thin burger that tastes like liver with plastic cheese topping . french fries were ok , but small on portion .
stop by here today while visiting canada . the store was located across the street from my hotel . the yelp reviewers hyped me up to thinking the food was awesome . the people that own the place was super nice .
my very first time here and on a monday check in the lines are ridiculous , a super long walk from parking to end up in a very slow check in , have already been standing in line for 20 plus minutes , this is ridiculous .
tech not friendly . after not being able to see or find anything . .after 5 minutes still charged and she was not apologetic or anything , they were more worried about there 25 dollars more than anything . restroom was also disgusting .
not sure what has happened to this once fine restaurant the last few months . it 's been a favorite of ours and we 've been regulars for years but will never return .
i called to give in my order for a take away . and i specifically told them no to put fish eggs .
think your health insurance covers labcorp ? think again . i 've never heard of a company that can not tell you the price of lab work when you 're there - then send you a $ 700 bill in the mail two weeks later .
i 've been shopping at a number of gc stores ( ca , nv , ny ) , for years ! sure , everyone has their bad days , and we can all relate to that .
we went through the drive thru , waiting 10min to order . legs and thighs special . they did n't ask if we wanted original or crispy , told us we could n't substitute mashed potatoes for coleslaw .
18.00 to get my ears waxed . i have never paid that much . no i did n't tip . its hit a or miss as far a pedicures i have had good ones and bad ones here .
the sign says nyc bagels . i grew up in nyc eating real bagels . this places does n't come close ! the best nyc bagels i have found in phoenix are at the bagel man in ahwatukee .
i wish i would have looked at the reviews of this location before i placed an order . for superbowl sunday i ordered 3 pizza 's for my friends and i to be delivered at our hotel .
oh my gosh ! if you can not make your signature dish good then you should not be in business . i tried their pho dac biet and the soup had no pho soup taste at all . the beef and the tripe were bland too .
i placed my order at the drive thru and from the time i paid until the time i reached the pick up window it was 10 minutes . even when i got to the pick up window , no one showed up for a good minute .
do not know how this place got such good reviews . waitress or the owner of the place was cutting her nails in the back .
maybe it was a bad night . there is a lot to choose from from an asian food stand point . do not come here if american food is on your agenda . my family and i came on a tuesday night around 530 .
this is the second time i have been here & had terrible service . the place looked like a bomb went off with packages all over the place . long wait with only one young gal working alone & clearly overwhelmed .
part of my order was missing . there were hard inedible bits in some of the dishes . everything was way too sweet . large lumps of chicken fat . no balance to the flavours at all . greatly overpriced considering the quality .
i should have listened to the previous reviews . how is it okay to keep patients waiting over an hour and a half after their appointment time , to be seen ?
very poor quality the donuts tasted like they must 've been from yesterday or the day before -- the worker was not friendly and appeared to be only concerned about the bottom line . i 'm not even a donut expert , but they tasted like shit .
horrible service ! we waited over 20 minutes to get a beer and were never served . we asked for water and did n't even get that . go there if you want to waste your time !
this used to be a good location but now that they have that new manager it has really gone down . we now make our twice a week orders at papa johns .
ppl come here for the cheap patties with coco bread . there is no place to wash your hands , or any place to sit and eat , no washroom , but they do have horrible rude service if that is your thing .
the management office will not handle anything feel free to do what ever , park where ever you like . there are absolutely no rules here .
rip offs ! this lady was just trying to make a buck off of me . better to just buy your flowers from the supermarket and get your own vase - saves you $ 30 .
here we are in april , after ordering glasses in december of last year . still have n't recieved them . was told office manager would be in today to talk , called out sick . will never be back again .
would of gave 1 2 star . i 'm the least pickiest when it comes to pizza but i would rather eat a hot pocket from a microwave than from this location again .
if i could put negative stars , i would ! this is the worst office i could imagine . not only are the staff completely rude and misinformed , they have no clue how to be empathetic , let alone listen to what the patient has to say .
the worst buffet i have ever had in vegas or reno for that matter ! everything tasted like it was frozen food , no flavor and way overpriced for the garbage that they served . stay away !
called to book a client with them and the rep said '' no thanks '' ! and continue to hang up the phone like i was a bill collector . i had to call back twice before she picked up again . that 's not good service .
my husband and i love subway and would eat here 2x a day if i was n't so frugal or the sandwiches were n't so full of sodium but this location is horrible !
we got orange chicken and pas thai noodles . service was good but food was terrible . worst orange chicken of my life : (
i took my ranger crew in 3 weeks ago and it is still not finished . they are charging me $ 2100 for the repair . they have no parts in stock .
shit hair cut . do n't go here . terrible customer service . care about phones more than you
food was yuck at best . service meh . drinks inconsistent . do n't waste your money or time
food is overpriced and was n't that great . the wait for the food was very long and the service was terrible . the options for dinner were very limited .
absolute worst experience pawning and purchasing with these guys . i usually am just buying things , so i 'll talk about that . they ask full retail for used stuff and add $ 1 accessories to make it look like they are saving you money !
what a disappointment ! i have been seeing dr. kells for some time now and had been happy with his services .
just finished a meal here and it was the worst meal i 've ever had . we picked this restaurant because it was in our hotel binder as a suggested place in the area . horrible service . steak tasted like it was boiled .
over priced . they ran out of food and plates ! this is the second time that something !
my family and i went to buy something from them today . i have two little kids and i was initially pleased to find out that they had a popcorn stand for the kids . it is definitely a good way to keep the kids occupied whilst we shopped .
after that expose on dirty dining , i just can not bring myself to go back . and the people are so nice there and that food was good , but .
probably the worst taxi cab experience ever ! our driver had strong body odor and was very rude ! he had no knowledge of the area and kept turning around ! basically felt like we were going in circles !
there really is n't anything good to say about this salon unfortunately . while it 's new within the past year , the place looked older .
i hate to be the fly in the ointment for all perfect reviews ( are they real ? )
the pad thai was pretty good , but the food took two hours to arrive . the curry dishes were quite expensive and did not include rice , which was very disappointing .
normally , i like chipotle . my daughter goes here all the time . i used the convenience of ordering online because i was busy at the house and she was already out . she gets home , and no side orders of guacamole . i had ordered 2 .
i have worked in the service industry for a good majority of my life and i have never been more frustrated with service received , or lack thereof .
polite but very slow service when they were not even busy . my father ordered the caesar salad with chicken - only ate half & ended up being sick that night and next day . do not eat here ! there are better places in scottsdale .
burgers were n't bad . the fat cow behind the drive thru window had such a nasty attitude . shoved money in my hand , when food came she handed it and said here u go '' . closed the window and turned her back .
went there after eating at subway next door . all chairs were unoccupied . very clean environment . the blonde hair girl who cut my hair said she just got there and turned on tv . great highlights of nfl was on. ( awesome ) .
worst dining experience i 've had ever ! my 23.00 steak was unseasoned and rubbery . the 18.00 crab cakes were disgusting according to te people that ordered them .
most horrible experience ! went around 9pm , the cashier in drive thru was rude , she would not let me get a word out without speaking over me .
i 'm not going to write some big sob story about my experience with this company . bottom line is their customer service is horrible and they do not return your calls . they cancelled appointments and did not have the bid in on time .
the worst chinese restaurant i have eaten in town . rude server , bad food which made me sick . it took me about two hours to get the food . i have ordered the spicy crab which is soggy and soup is cold .
it was empty when we got there . the waitress made a passing comment about how the size of the menu usually affects the quality of the food , which should have been our red flag .
booked their service and was left stranded in brampton . i called the operator and they were not apologetic at all mentioned that due to the time change this had confused a lot of scheduled pickups and my driver was else where .
cab driver charged us $ 33 for a trip from the airport to the westin , about three miles . when we checked and found out the price should have been under $ 14 we called lucky cab and gave them the drivers id and cab account number .
do not waste your time and money . worst facial i ever got . read the reviews with one star and you will know the truth . all reviews with 5 stars are fake .
sorry but not good disappointed the donut was dry over cooked perhaps workers need to be trained properly ! coffee was not good either ! needs improvement it 's a drive thru it should be making money i hardly ever see cars or people : (
everyone was great except for the guy doing the repair ! he did a horrible job
unprofessional ! does n't even deserve one star . this business should be shit down ! first off , the guy took an hour to show up when he estimated on the phone it would be about 20 minutes .
i wish that i could give david 's in strongsville a better review , but i just ca n't . i had an 11:30 appointment and it took about 10 minutes for them to find me a consultant .
tonight is the second and last time i attempted to eat at the restaurant .
beware ! the most dishonest mechanic shop i have ever seen ! if there was a zero rating i would give them a zero . we brought them my husband 's car for a transmission repair . this is what they 're known for - right ?
music is so loud it 's impossible to have a conversation . when management was asked about this , he was unapologetic , said loud music is there concept .
come on guys u got the best food in town , but ur workers are rude and unfriendly .
the haircut i received was not bad but it was not what i asked for . the barber seemed to think he knew what i wanted better than i knew what i wanted and did as he pleased with my hair which is not ok .
i do n't know why the post office hire people that have no personality and who are not cut out for the job . this post office sucks . they never answer the phone , have you on long holds , and they give you the run around .
i do n't know how this place has ok ratings . and yes you can go wrong with paying just 10 dollars ! horribly wrong ! you get what you pay for ! i paid for gas , parking and 10 bucks to get my hair ruined !
many things went wrong during our visit this past weekend . dirty wet plates on the table , slow service and poor food execution . we were served cold bread with butter on the side upon arrival .
as most of the other reviews point out , these guys are scam artists . do n't get lured into the store and let them touch your skin with their product .
yelp reviews said it was good , checked it out before a dr. appointment , no selection of pastries , or breakfast stuff , and out of ice ?
i do n't get this place ! i stopped by for an early lunch based on all the good reviews . the sandwich was okay at best , not much filling , the fresh made bread is a nice touch but did n't add tremendously to the sandwhich .
been going there for the past 10 years . it used to be great . for the past few months the food is getting lousy . if you noticed not much people are going there anymore .
the place has gone downhill . it is need of repair . the courses are ripped and falling apart . when i notified the individual working there he replied i just work here . ''
giving 0 star if i could ! they should teach their staff to treat their customers nice and right the manager named christopher is very rude ! and also they gon na charge you for the rooms that you did n't reserve ! beware !
it is impossible to book an appointment by phone due to long wait times . i booked an appointment on the web and they left me a message to tell me that time is not available . i think i will look elsewhere .
they work with an incompetent pool company based on the following : in the last six weeks three different people from the pool service have been out and all three have refused to look at the pool pump controls to take it out of service mode .
i love mom and pop owned places , burger joints , pizzaria 's etc . .but this one missed the mark for me . i recently moved up to aurora from markham and this pales in comparison to tom 's burgers .
is it possible for there to be a tooth in the burgers ? i just bit down on part of a tooth and it 's not one of mine . also , i asked for lots of hot sauce , she gave me one .
2 words . never again ! just that simple !
i bought a hp laptop in late oct , with the add on 's ( they can fail in first two years . '' ) , transfer of data from old counter and so called premium installation . i spent a bit of cash .
i went to this restaurant today with friends for lunch . the restaurant was maybe half full . it took them 36 minutes to bring coffee . we had to get up and ask for it and then it still took 10 more minutes . the food was fine .
the bitches behind the counter ( old & young ) need to be fired . sick of coming in and getting an attitude like i 've interrupted their time , no you 're at work do as your told and do n't give me attitude about it .
i 've eaten here 20+ times , and it has been going steadily downhill each time . the last time it took an hour to get our food . an hour . let that sink in . an hour . and it has happened 3 times now .
we noticed the banner saying under new management so we decided to give this place a try . the good : the service from the waitress was excellent . she was on the ball and we did not have to ask for anything . the bad : 1 .
this place would not leave us alone about being christian ! they had bouncers rotate to tell us we had to leave about our small gold small chain cross on our neck .
terrible ! save your money and get a boba tea , smoothie or whatever else they offer somewhere else . tapioca pearls tasted old and gritty . fruit smoothie was terrible , tasted super artificial . i should have gone with my first instinct but noooo .
this place took 50 minutes with my order after stating 30 on the phone , and i come in to pick it up and have to wait another 20 minutes after said time .
very unfriendly staff . not very nice for younger kids . employees dont explain just yell at you when you are doing wrong .
service was great . the food was disgusting . ordered clam chowder and it was barely warm . then ordered fried shrimp and the shrimp was not deveined . seriously ? i 'm paying $ 18.99 for fried shrimp with the poop vein still intact ? ugh .
i left urgent care for cvs to get a prescription filled . i have a kidney stone so i needy prescription filled for a piano med and antibiotic . we waited 10 minutes while watching the pharmacist fill prescriptions and he totally ignored us standing there .
got a delivery from here tonight . really wish could give it no stars and had read reviews first . firstly to get delivery you need to order over 40 dollars worth , which is a bit annoying .
i have no clue why this place has a 4 star rating , other than the cheap prices ! average wings , over cooked cheese sticks with the cheese leaking out everywhere .
trash . its like a gross ass food truck inside a convince store . i highly do not recommend this place . just turned my stomach thinking about the food poisoning this hole in a hole caused me
horrible horrible horrible !
horrible ! we ordered delivery online and our meals showed up 40 minutes late ! the delivery driver did not apologize or explain why our order was late . to make things worse our food was completely cold .
if i could rate less i would . absolute worst experience . waste of money . went in with a jeep and after the wash told cost extra to dry your car . left dirt all over and knocked the hood bumpers off .
i 'll never go to this dentist office again . i 've removed my business as well as that for the rest of my family . they diagnosed my 4 year old with 2 cavities and began to fill one .
i 've never seen so much excrement in a public bathroom before . most of the bathroom stalls are broken and do not close , and it is clear this place never gets a cleaning . i need a shower after using this restroom out of desperation .
i was in the pet store yesterday afternoon . the puppy pens were dirty and there was dried poop in some of the cages , as in it had not been cleaned up in a while .
why does it smell so bad in this bar ? the sound system is so crazy loud , you ca n't hear anyone speaking . the food takes forever to get to your table . crazy prices for drinks . and did i say that it smells !
they had all the channels i wanted and than they were taken away now i 'm stuck in contract and have to find a new way to watch my favorite shows
rude service we just asked for water and they wont even give it to us . we had to go to the subway next store to ask for a glass of water . definitely not coming back another time .
food was miserable , service was mediocre . i ordered a dish with 2 types of pasta sauce . first time it came out the food was cold .
my husband gave flowers by renee another chance . the first bouquet he ordered from there was worse than pathetic and we complained . the owner came to our house with an apology and another bouquet .
used to eat here several times a week . but in the last year , literally four out of five times i go here , they 've run out of chicken . if it happened once in a while that would be understandable .
went there for something very simple , waited 6 hours . watched the nurses and interns gossip about their lives while people were screaming in pain . overall , the place looks filthy , unkempt , and dreary .
horrible customer service . rude and unwilling to help me . had a simple repair that needed to be done in one of my tires and they refused to help me and instead told me that i have to get a whole new set of tires .
went there to get my screen crack fixed and once i got home i realized half of it was popped out . i went back and they fixed it for me . a week later my phone wo n't charge . i 've only had this iphone since may .
crap restaurant with terrible service . you 're better off at the mcdonald 's or taco bell across the street .
i went to this hotel and i will never stay here . the female male who was working the desk was a total bitch . plus over charge for stuff snacks ! friend was staying here and she did n't like the person who was working the desk .
this elderly customer service guy by the name of bob '' is extremely rude to customers . he yelled at me just because i asked him couple of questions he did n't have answer for . he really insulted me in front of huge line of customers .
i 'm not sure if it 's the home warranty company . oneguard . we have had beyer out 4 times to fix our refrigerator , including the wed before memorial day . now . the tuesday after memorial day .
it 's true what the reviews say on here . the employees are terrible ! like really who hired these people ? snotty looks and when my husband needed a fitting room they all just ignored him .
this is poor excuse of a business , i placed my order two months ago i got it today and was left at my front door . did n't hear a word from the delivery team on when to expect my order .
poor customer service . shopped for tires on website , seemed like a pretty good deal . scheduled an appointment 3 days later . when i arrived , they had no record of appointment nor did they have the tires i wanted in stock .
save yourself the trouble , get your car serviced somewhere else . i know , i know , this is the acura dealer in vegas , but believe me , it is a nightmare . promised parts are n't ordered , calls are n't returned .
well i used to love coming here , i recently changed insurances and i called to verify they took my insurance and everything would be covered as it was with my previous plan .
spinato 's adds 18 percent gratuity , in addition to a delivery charge , to delivered orders . no matter how good their product is , there is no justification for that , and they do n't deserve your business .
i like the actual store '' but getting some help is the worst ! my 1st visit last week i had to call the store while in the store 3 times to get help in the bakery .
i usually shop at the eastern location but they were out of a certain scent . so i came to ts location . the staff were so unfriendly ! almost rude . just poor customer service .
i do n't know where to start . imagine your most ridiculous customer service nightmare and then times that by 10 . you 'd start to get close the experiences i 've had with this unethical , unprofessional business '' .
my dog food ( frozen raw food ) was $ 12 higher than what i paid for at a different dog food stores .
update- i 've now had 5 burgers , in search of a bit of beef ; since i live out in the country , this is closest . every single one was raw to the point of barely thawed . disgusting .
their customer service is horrible ! even if it was mediocre i 'd overlook it as they carry some unique stuff and i love to bake .
i had my nails and hair done here . manicure tables were unclean , they used stained towels , employees spent too much time talking amongst each other . to say my manicure was messy is an understatement .
would not recommend for tires of you need replacements . they do not have the correct equipment . i also scheduled an appointment and it took almost three hours to install tires . i also had my oil changed on a previous visit .
very rude receptionist . i simply called to see if they received my referral . she was too lazy to check and see . she did n't even ask me for my name so she can check to see if they received it or not .
these people are incompetent they left the windows down in my car i have leather interior i ask for a refund for my money and was denied . i have called corporate and i have call my bank regarding the charges i have posted pics as evidence of their incompetence
i called late in the afternoon and was told that a tech would call me that evening or in the morning . at 11:30 i called them and was told a tech would call me but would be no problem being here by 2pm .
did n't provide bread prior to entrees . told later , we could have ordered six biscuits for $ 1.50 . very tacky of a place trying to impress . the seafood cocktail , shrimp and crap meat did n't come with a cocktail fork .
i 'm sorry but the taro boba and the green tea boba sucked so bad . yuck . i swear that green tea boba looked brown as hell . never coming here again i swear . i had better taro and green tea boba .
i had a friend in town & we could n't get in because of guys in our group wearing jeans with holes in them . one of them was wearing the same jeans from the night before & he was as let in then .
i went in to several pounds of colored m & m 's for a birthday party because they were on sale . it was advertised ( and the sign said ) $ 2 off each pound .
omg ! this was the worst thai food i ever had . we went there today because of all great yelp reviews , but was so disappointed in the thai beef noodles i ordered . it was so tasteless and horrible .
spend an hour getting ready , go down elevator , walk around corner and bam . basically assaulted by an employee with an eye serum pulling me in and sitting me in her chair . horrific experience .
worst customer service experience ever . it has been over 2 weeks and i am still so mad at this company that i can not think of enough horrible things to say . i asked to speak to the manager owner and was told no .
had a scheduled appointment and this service did not show up or have the professional courtesy to call and say they could not make it . i even called and received a vm . never responded . if you need a reliable service , do not use this company
terrible service ! i waited for over 10 minutes before i was even helped , there was no line and the guy who was supposed to be taking orders was sitting at a booth instead of doing his job .
had a greek salad - it was $ 7.50 for wilted lettuce and onions . yuck . i like to support local places , but not if the quality stinks . i wo n't be going back .
my cousin 's wedding was last weekend and all of the groomsmen rented their suits here . my boyfriend was measured and then when we came for his fitting , his suit was so loose and baggy .
they broke a passenger side mirror on my car , i filled out a damage report and was told i would be contacted . after a month of them giving me the run around i was told they would not do anything .
awesome location , beautiful design and very comfortable seating area ! i love the statue of the children .
if you respect yourself and think highly of customer service , this is not the place to work . there are so many other companies out there that need quality drivers and will treat you as such . .not divine michelangelo transportation !
awful service . never had a chance to even try the food . rude staff and poor customer service .
when we first moved here a few years ago it was great . it was our go to for pizza . being from new york it was great . we went over the weekend and it was awful . we heard there were new owners .
arrived at 830 with a 2hr layover and decided to get brunch or regular breakfast since it was a sunday . well fat chance of getting a mimosa or any alcoholic beverage . they serve alcohol after 12 noon .
there is a veronica ruiz working here ( cocktail waitress ) that we are looking for . she was caught stealing yesterday and when caught started fighting staff members . she a local known prostitute in charlotte . please dont let her work at such a beautiful place !
a sad place with sad mediocre franchise food . the staff appeared unenthusiastic working there which i guess is understandable . there are way better choices nearby .
i have been here in arizona for 10 years . i have been to over 500 different restaurants . this one was my worst experience . the food was awful . my party was 6 adults and everyone could not believe how bad the service and food was .
took the car in for a 5k mile service . good price , did n't get a scare tactics sales job -- there 's your one star . unfortunately , somehow they screwed up the battery .
scorpions everywhere ! we have found 12 in the past 5 weeks . i have been stung two different times . not a safe place to live .
this is not a philadelphia establishment . the owners seem to be greek . the default cheesesteak comes with lettuce and tomato ! i ca n't imagine how wilted that lettuce would be . average cheesesteak , poor decor inside . the fries were decent .
service was very slow . we had to wait about 45 min for our food and restaurant was not busy . food was over priced . $ 16 for a sandwich is not really reasonable even if it was piled high with meat .
this place is just bad . we were delayed over 5 hours coming home from vegas and needed somewhere to eat lunch . decided on this place and was not the best idea .
this is the worst pharmacy i 've ever been to . i visited twice , both times i was treated extremely rudely and found the staff has no concept of customer service .
staff smoke in front of the entrance . they blow smoke into customers faces who are behind them . in store staff yell at customers . i honestly ca n't think of any reason to shop at this store .
i suggest having a consultation before engaging this business . the level of professional attire , demeanor , and salon room cleanliness was not up to my standards , but i do realize that each person has different tastes . i ended up having my hair color redone .
i love vegas ! but i 'm . never impressed with this airport at all . it 's so old and is in major need of remodeling !
no no no do n't eat here ! i was traveling with family and i wanted indian food . i was so excited to see this close to the hotel . i ordered chana masala the menu say that it included rice .
extremely over priced and if you let them they will try to take advantage of you . my girlfriend recently took her car in for an inspection and was told she would n't pass without a cabin air filter and wipers .
love love love the food , i 'm sad to give a bad review . but , the last 4 times , they screwed up our order in the drive through . i 'm sad .
let me start off by saying that i do n't eat meat . we checked their website and they have a special section for their veggie food . we found out that they do n't have veggie options available on their menu .
a simple gel polish manicure turned into two hours because of the technician doing a sloppy job . way below par customer service and was still charged $ 46 ( again a two hour simple gel polish ) . this was my second really disappointing experience with this salon .
horrible ! i 'm not one to write reviews on my experience because in a business i understand there are good and bad experiences but this place tops a bad experience .
quite possibly the grossest bathrooms i have ever seen . i 've been to truck stops that were cleaner . sign on door says bathrooms checked and signed by employees every 15 minutes . and the chart was empty .
after sushi in china town , i had the idea to go get foot massages with my boyfriend . found this place on yelp , and the reviews seemed good . we went there and they had a special going on . 1 hour for full body . ''
went in to look at a two bedroom apartment for maybe leasing , the guy in the office was unorganized 1st and for most , secondly told me if i was interested i would have to put in an application for my daughter who is only 12 .
i can understand why this company has only a star and a half rating . by far the worst , most unprofessional , unresponsive plumbing company .
just do n't stay here . by the time you pay for wifi that actually works you could afford a much nicer hotel . do n't stay if you want a non-smoking room . the side entrance is used by smokers and the smell permeates the rooms .
this place is an absolute joke if you have a 9-5 job and try to go after work . they sell as many memberships as possible for very low prices so you get a great mix of broke ass awful people in this gym .
this place has really gone down hill since dr evans retired . i have been taking my pets here for 7 years and dr evans was amazing . i took my animals there soon after he retired and was disappointed with the service .
if this is the one near chase bank and across from starbucks they always have a line and 80 of the time i either do n't get what i ordered or drive off with someone else 's meal . what 's strange is my change due is always correct .
yelp please give us a zero star score . this is an awful company . they prey upon the poor , minorities and those who truely want to make their credit better .
started out really impressed with this complex . however , it now feels very unsafe . several break ins occurred the weekend of 4 15 . video clearly shows the criminal has a gun and is prepared to use it .
total rip off for food that is mediocre at best . chicken curry is $ 10 for something that is nearly all rice , and the curry is almost all cheap root vegetables with an off flavor .
i love this place because the food is healthy and reasonably priced , however - the service is always terrible . the drive thru always takes at least 10-15 minutes . when we go in the employees will be sitting down eating , or too busy talking .
being a food truck junky i had been wanting to try this truck for a long while . they were voted best burger during a recent street food throw down so i knew it had to be good !
i you want to spend $ 12.00 for the worst haircut ever , this is definitely the place to go . this place is a horrible .
needed my backyard remodeled . set up an early morning appointment with todd . my husband took the morning off to meet with him . todd never showed up and never called to apologize or explain .
such a terrible place , went there with a friend ( mind that we are teenagers ) . the ladies decided to charge us wayyyy more than we bargained for , rushed through everything and were totally rude .
flat beer and staff had little knowledge of the beers they offered . i ca n't eat fast food bc it severely upsets my stomach , their food made me sick too .
i 'm so disappointed by their lack of attention . i got there for service . lots of employees everywhere nobody came to serve me . after 5 minutes , i had to go and find somebody to help me .
i can see where this place would do well with the college crowd , but my experience will not bring me back . the warning signs were all there .
would not ever return to this location . i clearly received old french fries that had been refried . the burger was bland and does not reflect the price you pay .
i have had many problems with our internet connection with cox and working from home creates a huge issue for me . i have called multiple times throughout the past month to fix this issue .
hours are not as reported ! doors do unlock the reported time but they look at you like idiots when you walk in expecting to get served . better check there even in business before going here , probably wo n't last long .
i highly suggest going to the mcdonalds on mcclintock and elliot , aside from always getting my order correct and fill my soda all the way to the top but they also hire cashiers who know how to count change correctly .
this is a tip to toronto police : i seriously suspect his restaurant is involved in some kind of money laundry . why ? how else does a restaurant stay in business with such poor tasting food and service , while being on the second floor ?
well ! from most of the reviews this will be the same and obviously will make no difference in their service . 1.25 hrs late no car seat for infant as requested , driver was so rude ! at this point you have no options to get another ride !
staff , if you can get someone to help you , are not very friendly or helpful . it is disorganized and chaotic . the one pottery that was done was not ready the day it was promised .
i sat out in the cold for half hour with my four children waiting for a taxi driver that was supposed to be there within 15 minutes of the call .
please research your water companies as you may not want to give your hard earned money up to a company that had you known from the beginning , you would certainly not have gone through them .
not suitable for last minute deliveries . especially on mother 's day . very rude customer service and a faulty web program . do not order online , in fact do not order at all .
after making an appointment online arrived half an hour early the wait time was over 3 hours . still sitting here waiting , i will never come to fastmed urgent care again . the receptionist said they only have one provider on the weekends .
emily the shift manager was n't very helpful . i saw her use the restroom and then make a sandwich without washing her hands . i would highly recommend you do not go to this subway on boulder and russell .
buyer beware - i booked an appointment with the vendor approximately 10 days in advance and noted upon arrival that they had overbooked a large number of clients . i drove over 30 minutes to mississauga only to be informed that they could not accommodate my appointment .
i would not recommend using this agency . we used them to book a group flight . first issue was the accounting was incorrect on numerous occasions . we were told one thing then the amount changed .
if you have the time please drive to a different subway . this subway does not clean their knives when cutting sandwiches . dried food left on knife .
new cadillac and first service left a lot to be desired . if a company is going to offer services then honor them . very disappointed so far . expressed concerns and zero response .
awful undercooked . got the runs from one piece . paid $ 22 for large crappy pizza that got me sick .
the staff is literally pants on head retarded . they are n't knowledgeable about any vape liquids , and their selection is very limited . do n't waste your time . massive fail .
it was some of the worst food i have had . i had 2 beef enchiladas and the beef was burnt . the best part was the refried beans and the drink . i would not recommend this place to anyone .
the absolute worst care i 've ever received from any company . doctors office . you name it , this is ranked number one most horrible . rough painful care with a side of mean disrespectful attitudes !
went to this einstein 's on a saturday morning and they were so unorganized and falling apart . after being first in the order line for 15 minutes they still failed to acknowledge us or any of the other waiting customers .
i came here because i wanted to see if it was going to be as big of a shit storm as it was on tv . it was . i think the people that gave it 4 or 5 stars expected to eat poop .
never actually made it into the salon because the receptionist was super unfriendly and hung up as soon as i said i wanted to think about the appointment . definitely will not be booking anything with them in the future !
they troll areas with hoa on holidays - no one called in our car - they rolled in looking for money . 1 hour and towed our car ! happy new year and enjoy that $ 150 ! never use these theifs !
i came here for threading and she is watching videos in youtube even i 'm here . and when i asked her to do my threading little slow , she said once you tell slow and once you tell fast in a rude way .
my order : pad thai with chicken , crab rangoon , and pot stickers . all were awful ! the pad thai was not pad thai . it was a mess of broken noodles , a couple bean sprouts , and some boiled chicken .
i think this is a hit or miss endeavor . they provided no confirmation to the reservation made by phone ( they do n't do online ) then charged me twice , and changed their web site to no refunds '' after i called to complain and then cancel .
i wish you could put a zero . they have the worst customer service ! i have to call constantly for my newspaper due to no delivery ! tried of their excuses !
this place has horrible service . they do n't even deserve a serve a star ! and if you have a crowd in the place of under thirty why are you playing music from the 60 's !
they were understaffed and we had to wait so long to pick up the car ! when we returned it they charged us extras for early return '' ! did you ever hear something like that ?
used to go here quite a bit , but the customer service is absolute garbage now . the food is not worth the attitude of the lady who is doing you such a favor by selling you a mediocre sandwich .
horrible experience . horrible customer service . manager would not leave their office to come out to the floor and help . the associate had to go back and forth to their manager for an answer with no solution . i will not ever return to this location .
garbage service ! place was n't even packed when we went in sunday morning . we stood at the front for a bit until i asked if it 's self seating but the employee said no and they would clear off one of the available tables .
this has been my local mcdonalds for nearly 3 years . i 'm posting now because i 'm moving out of the area . thank goodness .
meh . average boba tea , average service , average seating , loud music ( not a good place to study though i saw someone doing so ) . there are better options around . they do have some outdoor seating . edit : owner left an obnoxious comment .
i have had yoshi 's before and never had a problem . but i have never been to this one until recently . it looked clean inside , but as i learned looks can be deceiving . i wound up with food poisoning the next day .
if i could give this place negative 5 stars i would . my grandfather was found laying in the floor this morning . even after yelling for help there was no one there . once assistance was found , the nurses gave attitude .
this is truly a dive bar . went in 2 sunday 's ago to watch a game . they have a bunch of tvs but only 2 were hd . wait staff was not friendly . food was crap . dark , dingy , wo n't ever visit again !
dish is terrible ! they told us when we signed up that we had no contract , but they put us in one .
we had scheduled a grooming for our dog . my wife even went in and spoke with the groomer to discuss our specific needs we needed for our dog the week before and got everything lined up .
as an urgent care , they suffice . cold , uncaring , atmosphere and long wait times can be expected when you can walk-in to your appointment same day and receive treatment . as a primary care facility , just do n't do it .
i went in there for a microderm facial on a thursday . by friday morning my face and skin were nothing close to what i would have expected for paying that much money for a facial .
this location is terrible ! employees are very rude and not well trained . the store looks dirty and filthy . this store has went down hill in the past years . i try my best to avoid going to this location .
this company also has a disturbing way of trying to avoid the do not list .
this place has great cars and great but dishonest customer service . if you are an average consumer or making your first vehicle purchase i do not recommend coming here or at least not alone .
run do n't walk to a different restaurant . i travel to this area for work quite often and i 've now tried bonefish 4 times hoping it would get better . the service is really slow and disorganized .
nl got off easy with only $ 2,000 of recommended work . i got my oil changed there today and was told my car should have $ 3,000 of work done . on a positive note everyone who worked there was friendly and courteous .
tried to become an established patient with this practice way back in october .
would give this place more stars , but i have n't tried my raspberry fritter yet . this review is for their drinks . unfortunately , they use powdered flavoring a for their drinks .
the employee has bad attitude and dressed like a bum . he looks like he was on drugs with terrible service . he was not professional and did not get the job done .
worst experience i 've ever had at a subway . they let a customer cut in line at noon for a drink . the breads always stale and meat tastes old . i took the time to write the owner with no response .
i 'm not sure if all sushi in montreal is bad but i ca n't understand how this place gets 3 stars . this was the worst sushi '' i 've ever had . i 've had better sushi at shop rite .
you get a tiny ( tiny ) burger for like 5 bucks , so to get a decent amount of food , you 're buying like a $ 15 burger -- oh yeah , and fries cost extra . seriously .
edible . that 's about the best i can say .
if there were a option for zero stars that would be my choice the store is horrible inside & out terrible cashier 's & lousy service .
well . basically i like dunkin though , it was a quite bad experience with a guy who took my order up front .
i recently moved to the area and yelped a starbucks . this location is the most convenient to me on my way to work . i do n't have much to say other than save your time and money .
this guy should n't be allowed to use the title doctor . '' he 's running a practice that 's more like a bad walmart than a professional medical practice . the staff was incredibly rude , general lack of professionalism
decided to try a red velvet cupcake thinking for the price $ 3.75 they would be delicious , but no looks can be deceiving . the cupcake was horrible . dry and very hard the frosting was not even sweet it tasted like plain butter .
one of the worst mcdonald 's in town . food is half cooked every time time i come here and tastes stale .
it 's just not good . the food tastes pre-made , frozen , and microwaved . canned veggies . i would never go there again .
treatments = fine . ability to get appointments at a convenient time = unacceptable .
staff was great with entertaining the customers , but that 's all it was - entertainment . this place does n't enforce rules , and people do n't play fair .
this place sucks for non smokers ! it is small and stinks to high heaven from the smoke . this is one casino that is small enough to change to a non smoking casino , and they would actually do better .
horrible establishment . there is only one girl there that is n't a complete b. i was told the wrong information , left a message one day and no one ever called me back .
cant use your starbucks card ! employees are so lost ! no organization .
this is quite possibly the most lackluster kentucky fried chicken in the valley . i have been going here for years due to their proximity to my house , but i am now convinced it is not worth the supposed convenience .
not up to par and overpriced for the below average results . too bad since my house is minutes away .
2 years of hell , they did nothing but lie to me , i spent countless hours on the phone with t-mobile corporate . customer service here , and follow through are not things they teach .
sorry i did a tip instead of a review . please see my review below . salesman turned me away for no reason . had $ 3000 cash in my pocket he was not interested in showing me a vehicle .
had always been very happy with t mobile since started with family plan in the 90 's , however waiting for them to correct a glitch in billing from october 2016 which caused out credit rating to drop 2 points . ouch !
called pharmacy for a next day prescription fill , they informed it would be ready by 11am next day . called next day to check on prescription and was told there was no prescription to pickup and the type of medication required me to physically drop it off .
probably the worst place i have ate at a n champaign urbana . had to settle for a dirty table because they do n't wipe down tables . and the food had that fresh out of the microwave pre-made consistency . will not be going back .
never put any of your stuff here . they have very very poor service and they make you wait forever to get your stuff . this is the worst storage rental ever !
did n't really care to take his time to cut my hair . he asked me if i had a picture to show him what hair style i wanted and he started cutting .
i 'm a big fan of chipotle . i go to it when i 'm out of state or in state and it has never failed me until today . very disappointed with the customer service here .
would not use them . they could not even get a surprise flower delivery executed correctly .
love the clothes and everything in the store except the jewelry . it 's so pretty but so cheap for being so expensive i payed almost 40 dollars for a necklace and it broke the next day my first time wearing it .
this place is horrible do not go here ! my package came in all crumpled up and open ! i will never use ups again !
i got the chicken teriyaki . horrible . my mom ordered the same and we both took one bite a d had to spit it out . the chicken was rubbery and cold . to be honest it did not even look like chicken .
the food at geno 's was just ok . the highlight of the meal was the bread . good flavor and tasted fresh . the atmosphere leaves a whole lot to be desired . there was a loud mouth obnoxious patron that ruined the entire evening for me .
i was in vegas on a vacation and went to this baskin robbins . there was paper in the ice cream , service was terrible and the bathroom filthy .
been busy so this is a late review . first and foremost , service here is 4.5 star ! very attentive for such a busy place on thursday . now . honestly . .i do n't know how this place is such a big hit .
wow how disappointing . visited this bar as part of a bar crawl package . where to start . majorly understaffed . imagine booking a hundred plus people in your venue and staffing three bartenders . bouncer was aggressive . finally made it inside .
pretty disappointed in our visit today . we were seated promptly and no wait , which is nice on a sunday during lunch . during this visit , service was slow , had to remind server to bring our drinks .
pheasant runs apartment are no good at all when it comes to service and helping their attends . shit complex to the extreme . they never fix anything here , washer dryers never work .
wow ! simply try to get an appt .
air conditioner is always broken . calling apartment people from last three days , do n't know what are they doing . maintenance man is not good at all .
went to this dq and there were 2 employees there . one was nicole who had probably the worst customer service etiquette i have seen in my life .
cashier was helping another individual with his order , then came my turn . as i stepped up to the register , he asked , what can i get for you ? ''
took my dog for grooming and while we were pleased with the staff our dog came home with fleas and gave them to our other dog . that took 4 months to get rid of . unacceptable !
waited an hour and a half the host would not let us order drinks from the bar or even sit at an empty table located outside the hole in the wall restaurant . where customer service is king someone should train these guys what customer service is .
the worst experience of my life . someone was sleeping in our room when we came in .
kung pao chicken is horrible . from the watery bland sauce to the raw peanuts . 2nd time i have been suckered into eating here . never again .
rating zero for boustan ! horrible delivery and phone order service ! never faced such rudeness on phone ! the delivery boy and the owner were extremely rude and ill mannered . clearly showed a lack of respect towards women .
the quality & service sucks here . i 'm not coming here again ever !
my experience was horrible . i was one of the first clients to arrive in the morning . i was immediately seated in a chair for my pedicure . the water was cold and was not asked if i was okay with that .
$ 50 for a battery with a one year warranty ? my burberry watch use the same battery that a cheap watch uses . unethical price gauging at its best .
terrible experience . ordered a pound of chicken wings and got 7 wings- supposed to come with celery and when i asked for it the waitress rudely said they did n't have any without any alternative option .
do n't be fooled by the nice beds and sheets . this bedroom has a bathroom with no door ! neither a folding door or a curtain ! nothing at all ! if you 're staying with your friends or family you will never have privacy !
the owner likes to post fake reviews of businesses who dont share his political views !
we went for the all you can eat sushi bar , and after 1 order of food , the sushi chef ignored us .
burn me once shame on you , burn my twice shame on me . i was left stranded at my off the strip '' hotel in december , but decided it was a one time mistake . well , they just did it again .
i 'm so grossed out right now , i got the hungry man combo to go with 4 pieces of chicken . when i arrived home i realized everything was cold .
this pharmacy is ridiculous ! every single time i 've come to get my prescription regardless of the time , i end up waiting over 20minutes ! do not come to this location ! it 's worth the drive to go elsewhere
wow , seriously bad service . we were waiting for our flight and sat down to eat . waitresses walked by but nobody came even after 15 minutes . i flagged one down but she gave me a dirty looked and walked the other way .
went in last week and spoke with very nice young lady about new boots that were painful to wear . she offered that they could stretch them .
i usually get acrylic nails , but when i last went he told me about this new process that was much healthier with no chemicals and that it would be cheaper to get a refill this route .
if i could give this place 0 stars i would , we placed an order on grubhub , we waited an hour and then we got a call from grubhub saying they canceled our order and would n't deliver to us bc it was too far .
terrible airlines avoid if at all possible . flight delayed an hour an the airport even the pilot did n't know why .
sophie the stylist is an extremely unprofessional individual . her assistant made an appointment with me that i waited almost a month for , then she calls me close to my appointment and tells me she 's not taking anymore new clients !
why is it that when you place an order you suddenly become victim to the lame , inept , useless employees behind the counter .
i tried this place out because it 's close to where i live . gel manicures i 've gotten at other salons always last for 2 1 2 to 3 weeks .
after reading so many wonderful reviews and checking out several other pool builders , we decided to sign a contract and put down a $ 500 deposit with presidential . our sales person roy made us feel like a burden and did n't meet one deadline he promised .
i have had for three years , last month card was not working . i called in and they say they closed my account due to a returned payment . i have used the same checking account every time .
they came out 2 times to fix water softer and the 3rd time they said they don ; t work on them and i paid $ 60.00 and did n't give my money back and is still not fixed .i would never use these people ever .
they have the most unhappy employees that i have ever seen in my life . the restaurant was filthy and i could n't find a clean table to sit at . after asking a cashier to clean one nobody came over so i cleaned one myself with a napkin .
so disappointed in the quality and very small potion of the kids mac n cheese . three bites for my 8 yr old and its gone . no cookie . no drink . and it was $ 6 . wont go back .
i called them out for a water main leak estimate . quoted 2 - 2.5 hrs for repair in labor and $ 100 in parts . total estimate $ 750 ! i guess they just wanted to collect my $ 49 fee to give a ridiculous estimate !
worst experience i 've ever had . literally the worst nail salon in las vegas . i was supposed to be given a free service for the last butcher job they did on my nails and i decided to give them another shot .
burger not good at all . onion rings cold . as i was waiting for my to go order , three people came back to the counter with mistakes on their orders . would rather have the circle k back that was torn down .
this place used to charge only 9.99 $ for comforters . they changed management and ever since it has been going downhill . the woman who i dropped the clothes off too was extremely rude to me .
my experience here was absolutely ludicrous . they had no idea what my appointment was scheduled for and were incredibly unprofessional and rude the entire time . my insurance company called them to verify everything but were also spoken to very rudely .
they told me i could n't get verizon with the iphone and such i have . i went over to the happy valley store and they did everything and helped me out get transferred over quickly .
coworkers and i went during happy hour to grab some drinks and food a couple of weeks ago . the happy hour area was understandably very busy , which would have been fine , but the manager in charge of seating groups consistently let groups ahead of us go .
this place is so slow ! and rude they make you wait 10 min to order . save your time and go to another location
your drivers are good people . your dispatch is an utter embarrassment to customer service .
no stars . i called to order food during open business hours and they told me they were closed because they were understaffed ? seriously ? i 'm a nurse and we are understaffed everyday ! figure it out . get it done . no excuses . just sayin '
i love turkey club sandwiches and order them from different places and this one . the biggest disappointment . i ca n't even really call this a sandwich - 3 very thick slices of bread that was few days old ( it was hard and rubbery . )
i 've come here twice for lunch with people from work and each time was worse . the ingredients are low quality and they use way too much salt in all of their dishes .
no one should even think about going here , just trust me . i dont need to explain why .
very poor customer service on the part of the sales department . i purchased a vehicle and scheduled an appointment the following day to take delivery . i arrived ten minutes prior to my appointment and found my new truck was unwashed and they could not find my paperwork .
just purchased our home & they came to check our heating which we did n't need done & they said it was part of our home warranty which it was n't .
have been waiting for over an hour already and was told by the front desk that it would probably still be another half hour . this is seriously unacceptable ! i do n't care how good the doctor is , i wo n't be coming back .
horrible horrible horrible ! complained twice and the manager never came over . got pot stickers and they were freezer burned and the wings were hard as a rock . service was average at best .
we used their services for our wedding after referrals from family members . when we taste tested the food everything was amazing and we could not wait .
i agree with everything tierra said . i attended there when the school was on probation , it may still be . one of the factors was the faculty , it did n't exist . only a few teachers taught in the ci field which was wrong .
this location has the be the worst ! this is my 3rd time hear and they have yet to surprise me when i go to order . there is never any chicken ready there is always a 15min wait then when i received my order the chicken is dry ?
no more tuesday special . will never come back again . chicken are very small compared to other places .
i wo n't be coming back here . awful experience last night with a server who had a major attitude problem . not to mention , they made our party sign a contract and we would be charged $ 100 if our party of 9 was missing any people .
if i could give 0 stars i would . i can not say enough bad things about this place . screwed up the job i commissioned twice . when i refused to pay until it was done properly , they told me to take gd project and leave .
we were looking forward to this new local breakfast restaurant . unfortunately we never actually got the opportunity to eat there . our group walked in , and right away the waitress was very confrontational . we seated ourselves , because she could n't be bothered to seat us .
this place sucks i do n't even know how they stay in business every time i go in here they 're dead and seems like no one shops here . they are very overpriced and barely have anything on sale . the ski section sucks .
was n't crazy about this place . got take out pizza . great , if u like under cooked doughy pizza . no bueno !
we stopped in for a beer and wings today . no service . no greeting . no i 'll be right with you '' . we were there for more than 10 minutes with servers turning a blind eye . will not go there again .
ca n't believe i 'm admitting to going to this place but need to forewarn others . i was desperate w a sleeping kid in the car after a long hike and was ready to eat the arse out of a yak . wish i 'd gone that route .
this place gets 1 star because you ca n't give 0 stars . the appearance is nice , at first glance , but it is a hollow vision indeed . the office staff smiles through their teeth , they like you till it does n't get them anywhere .
only got take out and got a grilled cheese . take the brie off the grilled cheese ! i love brie but it doesnt belong there . none of the cheese went together and it tasted like dish water . and the cheese to bread ratio was just awful .
i felt bad for the servers , there was only so much they could do . the table beside me had an issue with their food and she was scrambling . my chicken was dry but i did n't want to overwhelm my server .
automotive center is crap . please do not use it . other than that the store is okay . customer service is hit or well mainly miss .
close this mall down already ! it 's ghetto and the stores belong in a swap meet .
i visited this location this morning at 10:05 am . i attempted to use my 2 for 1 coupon . the manager ( ebony is her name ) said , no , you ca n't use this . it 's only for lunch . this is not true .
honestly the worst italian food i have ever had . when you get veal parm and it served with american cheese . enough said , sauce was terrible meatballs bland . i was beyond disappointed .
got a haircut and a clean shave here . haircut and fade was fine , however barber did n't know what he was doing for the straight blade clean shave . he said he nicked me below the lip area so he put the powder on it .
the salespeople here need a serious lesson in manners . just because you work where they sell nice clothes does not give you the right to act like a snob and look down on people .
used to come here all the time to get my dog 's nails trimmed but it seems they have grown careless over time .
drove from gibson city for school shoes . the brand that we usually get is libby and luca . was told yesterday was their clearance sale and they were all downstairs . had to beg the young man to wait on us and to get some shoes .
staff is great ! both doctors are not . they are culturally insensitive and seem to tolerate '' ethnic patients when i observe their interaction . additionally , they act as though you are trying to diagnose your child when they ask you to describe the symptoms .
geico sent them out for a jump start , they shore up with a half dead battery and no jumper cables . an hour wait in the sun and heat for nothing .
really upsetting experience with this place . i do n't like to write negative things , but unfortunately i need to share my experience . i went a year ago for a check up and a cleaning .
i purchased a print from a catalogue that was roughly $ 60 and was told it would be delivered from their supplier in no more than two weeks .
on a saturday evening , we waited 25 minutes without anyone taking our orders . first 15 minutes went by , we confronted the hostess and was told that a waiter will be with us shortly . waited another 10 minutes , still no one to take our order .
my husband and i drove 45 minutes for the grand opening just to find out they had a closed sign outside . the man inside told us they were not taking anymore people keep in mind this is at 1:00pm .
worst service i 've ever had at any restaurant ever ! had to get our own menus , took 10 minutes to get drinks , 30 minutes to get food and another 20 minutes to get check .
yelpers you led me wrong . i was trying to find a place where the hubs and i could get a massage near where we are staying . i was a little nervous about this place but it got good reviews so i thought why not .
this place had the worst service . it took me 45 minutes to get a beer and over 45 minutes to get someone to come by so i could pay .
i had a bad experience with getting my hair colored . what makes the whole situation worse is that management could n't even take the time to entertain a complaint . i 've requested to speak to the manager twice ( ! )
wow , what a slimey business - what a waste of my time ! i called ahead and was told they would deliver for $ 55 - which is pretty average .
service sucks and food not that great i eat one roll and that 's all it took for me to leave right away .
came here to have breakfast before going to church and i 'm truly overall disappointed with this place . first they did n't have what i wanted .
while waiting for our flight to leave we stopped here to get a bite to eat . since it was the only place that looked decent . combo meals are expensive . $ 12 . staff members are not friendly at all .
been here several times . slow service but you can count on the food being good . however , went this past weekend and was not impressed .
they pull the colored tags off the racks on sale day and the employees play dumb and say they 're just doing what they 're told . apparently 100 profit is a terrible thing .
hotdog is actually mush . apparently they do n't bother to take their time to change them out after several hours of cooking .
i have driven by this place many times and finally went in for lunch . my excitement for sharing a mix and match slider meal with my niece was quickly squashed as one of the sliders offered on the menu , was not available .
place sucks now . the owner joe is a piece of work that fired dorothy the solid manager .
wow i ca n't believe this company they first had my business 350.00 after checking with cox . then after finding out there speed is so poor and under performing in the market place for a business .
do no stay here if you plan to sleep before 2:30 am . they could not care less that there is a very loud bar directly across the street . if loudness does n't bother you than this place is fine .
pretty horrible food . dessert selection ok however but not worth price paid . lucky for $ 20 food voucher or i would have asked for refund .
do not use this company ! if i had been wise i would have checked these reviews and would have known not to use this company .
i purchased a tom ford perfume and later decided to take it back one day later for gift wrapping for someone 's birthday .
my son and i came to play mini golf here . i had seen that they had recently done some renovations and i wanted to come check it out . unfortunately i paid nine dollars for my son and i to play the most boring miniature golf course ever .
i had high hopes for this place , as it is right in the neighborhood . sat in the bar area - decent choice of beers , including some local craft brews . decided to eat off the happy hour menu - big mistake !
i 'd like to review the pizza but they kept me on hold 15 minutes and never did take me off hold . their pizza must be good because apparently their phones are too busy to help customers .
this place is embarrassing ! i was just in to get some food and as i sat down the two woman working behind the counter started arguing with each other . it was so embarrassing ! they were yelling and slamming things on the counter .
this place overcharges and provides absolutely no service to their tenants . their record keeping is abysmal , so you 're likely to keep getting overdue charges and threats to your lease for bills you 've already paid for through them .
i came to this excuse of a bar a few days ago and will never be back ! my wife and i both got white wine that was not cold but warm !
i love this golf course , but had an awful experience with customer service during my last visit .
this place is nice overall but as they say the devil '' is in the details . there are fees on top of fees at this place . yes they have the cheapest office visit price $ 39.99 but that is just the tip of the iceberg .
i came to this store from denver super excited to buy new hair . when i got to the store i wasnt greeted by anyone , and no one offered to help me . plus they dont let you try on the lace fronts and thats insane .
never ever ever eat one of their sandwich . the cook '' took literally 1 minute and half to prepare two cold sandwiches which were supposed to be philly cheese steak , meat was stale . mushrooms were barely defrosted . avoid at all cost .
rude staff especially tony c. in appliances please save yourself the time and aggravation . bought an lg washer and dryer had it delivered to the store only to be ignored for over an hour as tony helped everyone before me regardless of what order ppl came in .
business 's of avon and avon lake wake up . i just had another horrendous meal at a local restaurant that i am sure will close in 6 months . this so called asian bistro could n't even get me silverware let alone lousy food and of course service .
i ca n't say enough bad about this company . the salesperson was so pushy that he would not leave our house until we bought something . it was so uncomfortable . then he lied to me about whether we could install windows ourself .
every time i call they put me on hold immediately and keep me hanging on . the last time was 7 minutes of holding and i finally hung up without being able to speak to anyone . and this is even before a first appointment !
the service has definitely slipped from the last time i visited . it took over an hour for a sex on the beach ( 3 ingredients , come on ! )
i hate to say it , this location has completely gone to sh ! t . they used to have friendly counter staff , good portions , and a clean restaurant . now , the restaurant is virtually empty and not a clean table in the house .
do not go to this place ! it 's not even a salon , it 's just a rude old woman named gwen , she operates in a small room behind a big caucasian salon called high style salon .
do n't bother with this business . awful ! ripoff unprofessional poor language trash mouthed on and on and on . etc etc etc beware if you see an online deal
the service sucked . all the servers were huddled around some guy who i guess was the manager . we waited 15 minutes and still no service . we left and went next door tom the open air area at the mexican food place .
we were a party of 7 who came to celebrate a friend 's birthday . we were given a wait time of 20 mins . we waited for more than an hour outside . the manager never bothered .
after weeks of no response , i finally got a canned email from someone at alamo saying they would give me a $ 50 refund and understand my frustration . '' guess what ! it has been ten days since that email and still no refund .
most unreliable service i have ever encountered . had a 10:00 am appointment . had to call at 10:30 to find out what was going on .
almost a year after having about integrity movers move our home and cause over $ 700 in damages , we are still waiting for repair replacement costs .
decided to try a new pho place because i absolutely love pho and vietnamese food ! unfortunately we were not impressed by the food here , we ordered take out . .the pho broth tasted like cinnamon too much 5 spice perhaps ?
the food was ok , a little on the overcooked side , the atmosphere was nice .
awful service . awful experience . after a 40 minute wait for the food ( slow service ) , i received my salmon - two times returned because it was raw in the center ( note - i love sushi but this was wet raw ) .
suppose to be pizza with extra sauce . not . when i insisted on a refund the manager in duty tried to tell me they have no way to refund an order placed online . do i advise you not to place an order online .
food was not good . 18 gratuity on party of 4 and taxes are not included in the groupon . will not go there again .
not a well managed business ! took boat in for some extensive repairs , after they looked at it and tore it apart they decided they did not want to do the repairs due to the extent , which is fine i do n't have a problem with that !
prices are great to watch new movies . but it is very old and run down . i also feel itchy here the place grosses me out . not going back .
the first sign of trouble was that the waiting room was full . since i was having an ultrasound , i was asked to drink 32 oz . of water by 12:30 pm .
my wife and son purchased 4 different cupcakes as a surprise and they ate two of them and both ended up throwing up that night . we 'll never go back . they are not very good anyway , they have way too much icing and not enough cupcake .
the food here is sooo gross . the fried rice smells off . the chili chicken and sweet and sour chicken is full of fat , bone and cartilage . the sauce for both those dishes are goopy and gross .
i 'm going to spare the details of this kitchen nightmare to protect the guilty . went there on a friday and it was a mess - could not been have more poorly prepared to handle people who came to eat and drink .
i 've been here a few time many years ago so i thought i 'd give it another try but every time i 've tried no one answers the phone and no one returns messages as promised on the machine .
i went to total nutrition the other day to check them out after my work out . only one employee in the store and he spent 10 minutes talking to another customer and ignoring me .
thanks for the reply .
worst company ever . first of all get the mobile one for 75 $ i forget the name the machine goes off improperly if you eat the wrong thing and you will pay for that even though its the machine that is inaccurate
if i could give a negative score , i will . i sit in a delayed flight , bored enough to finally try to write a review for aa , which delays 95 of the time in my experience .
god forbid you have a bad experience with this business or they will come after you with harassment via yelp .
i 've never waiting in a fast food drive thru for so long . it 's been at least 20 minutes and that 's just the time that i waited at the window for my food . guess 6am is a bad time for breakfast burritos .
i used to love the main street deli . they were always pricey , but the extra cost was balanced with generous portions via the thickness of the sandwich .
there is only one thing i can say . this is the worst buffet '' i have ever eaten at in my life ! do not eat here ! even if it 's free .
was in there last night and was having a good time spending money and listening to music . that all ended when the manager got on the bar and started spraying champagne . who the hell wants to walk around sticky and smelling of shitty champagne ?
it is impossible to get any type of help here and the young girls working the cash register act like they are doing you a favor by letting you shop there .
i am always for praising people for a job well done . unfortunately my one and only interaction with this business was via phone and a complete waste of time . being new to the i 'm in search of new doctors .
i guess if you 'd never seen the atrium before the mgm got it hands on it you might be impressed . what an incredible downgrade . nothing here that one could n't find in the plant selection at home depot . heart breaking at best .
i drove into town from albuquerque for the weekend and i needed a place to stay for a couple days . i walked into the lobby and waited patiently for my turn to speak with the receptionist to whom was very rude and unhelpful .
my kid was eating broccoli and good thing i saw that there was a worm on it and grabbed it from his plate , so we called the waiter and told him about it .
square one shopping mall food court absolute disaster , due to non courtesy & disrespectful people who are ignorant .
been here twice . first time was just ok , average taco shop fare . the staff has a hard time with communication in english , but no big deal . well the second and last time , i had to explain 3 times what i wanted .
yucky ! feels like an establish basement party . although its cheap and the drinks are stiff , if i was going to get that atmosphere i 'd prefer to pay $ 5 for all i could drink beer & dollar shots in a college kids house .
workers are extremely rude ! i went in for my first spray tan and they did n't help me with instructions at all and when my friend tried to help me they came and screamed at my friend and i. i 've never been so disrespected as a customer
unprofessional , discourteous , uncaring , and a poor example of what an attorney should be . i highly recommend running the other way . i 've been screwed , i just pray no one else does .
terrible ! the spa bath was filthy and the service was awful . i walked out and went across the street .
ordered the vintage hot chocolate and a latte , almost 30 minutes later we get two cold drinks . we asked them to warm it up but the server was a bit rude . shit service but they may have been short staffed .
oh no ! we will never come back to this place ! their food was extremely bad ! my friend and i orderd tendon from regular menu . the tendon sucked !
just went to the drive thru here and got a quarter pounder delux and asked for a no sesame seed bun . i guess in mcdonald 's terms that means no bun at all ? seriously though this is the first place i have had that problem .
believe all the the bad reviews about this place . a friend and i went in hoping to get some food walking down st laurent - it was extremely bad and a waste of money .
bad service , what kind of gas station does not accept credit or debit cards . other than that they have a variety of products and a convenient location .
i recently had a mani and pedi at this place . i have been going to them for more than year now . i normally do shellac on my hands but decided to go with regular polish .
this would be a cool place to go ( pun intended ) , but the owners were so rude and unpleasant that i would never suggest anyone spend their money there .
i only like giving good reveiws on yelp . i 'm not one to bash businesses , but this place is terrible . we gave them a costume which is good quality material '' to dry clean . showed them that there is velcro on parts of it .
terrible customer service from people who should probably be only working for mcdonalds . went to pay a copay including my bill and credit card and was told to sit and wait for the 15 customers waiting to be called for their scans completing their paperwork .
had every intention of buying a expensive ring or earring set , no one asked me if i needed help . another thing i would have bought so much more but there is no price tags on anything hardly !
the taco salad was soggy and barely edible . i wont go back . go to del taco instead .
slimy . a good salesperson knows how to listen . these guys have no clue . yuck .
bad service . waited 35 minutes for a baked italian sandwich and chips . it was the saltiest sandwich i 've ever had . it was more like a calzone , not sure why it is listed ad a sandwich .
i was excited to try this place out after driving by it several times and seeing the fire places outside . i was disappointed to say the least . we were seated outside at a dirty table .
we 've been coming here for the last 7 years and it has just gotten worse . the property river ranch is in dire need of repairs . pool tiles falling off everywhere , there were caution cones along poolside as all the tiles underneath had fallen off .
this is my first time back at this restaurant and my wife 's first visit . the special vodka sauce and penne pasta with prosciutto look like it was served in pink dishwater . the place was full of drunks . never come here !
i used to go here almost on a weekly basis but for the past few months , they always seem to be out of certain items .
they did n't have football jerseys during preseason . when they did get them they did n't have very many and only had men 's sizes . no women 's and children .
they suck ! nothing gets done ! would nor refer . dish washer still dont work after 3 months of complaining to the manager . dont rent here !
granted , it was a school night . the bars next door were full of college students . this place was empty aside from us .
i used to love this place . had some good times there with lots of good food . now its just a memory . will never go back .
i generally use yelp to discover new places that have good reviews . i 'm actually writing one of my first reviews because of how disappointed i am . i love port of subs but i really hate this location .
i got this manicure done on saturday evening . it 's only been 4 days . they started chipping after the 2nd day . i know it 's not gel , but that does n't mean they need to be this low in quality .
the best thing about our meal was the company ( which is a good thing , because it was a first date ! ) and getting to use a tablet to order , which i had n't done before ! the food was less than average .
wow . service was slow , but nice at least . there was really no one there when we went , i have no clue what took so long . the menu isnt that impressive , i got a tuna sandwich with fries .
i was pushing my cart over to check out my items at one of the self serve registers , and hesitated because only small registers were available and i did n't want to deal with bag management .
the absolute worst taco bell ive been in the drive thru line for over 40 minutes . will never come here again !
i was late on a mortgage payment in january . summit credit union applied a late fee for 3 consecutive months without informing me .
beware ! all i have to say . .went in for one issue and they kept coming up with other things that needed to be fixed , which had nothing to do with what i went in for in the first place . did work without my approval .
dirty restaurant with horrible food . the pizza crusts they use are frozen and the ingredients are sub par . tons of employees standing around but not one clean table . would never go back or recommend .
poor quality . poor service . there are so many better options for any sports related products . other than the overpriced limited items , the staff are rude and useless . pass !
my first visit with dr. divine was good . he was very attentive , answered my questions and was thorough . then i got the bill for a couple hundred dollars . i was charged for every single thing we talked about .
went in to look for treats for my chi 's . not a good selection claims fresh baked treats but none available . so many puppies available priced outrageously . obvious mill puppies . taken from their mother too young .
i will not be back to this restaurant . i placed an order for pickup last thursday for myself and a co-worker . i had the small jerk meal and my co-worker had a side of collard greens . the chicken was hard , dry and cold .
ugh , do not go here . apparently , this place used to be amazing . used to . the food we ordered was flavourless , watery and not greasy at all . the portions were tiny .
i used to come in every week . but since i moved its been a little since i 've made it in . the service i got today was worse than any i 've ever received .
30 dollars for lunch ! my husband and i came in for lunch and ordered from the lunch menu , even pointed it out on the menu . waitress came back to get our order again .
horrible experience . cat groomer made me feel like it was my fault that she was booked with too many appointments . when my husband came in with our cat she had immediate attitude like she did not want to do her job .
while the owner was so incredibly nice and helpful ( constantly bringing fresh naan and dosas to the tables ) , this was unfortunately the worst indian food i 've ever eaten . everything was bland and oily , and we had queasy stomachs for hours after .
greasy ass breakfast burritos sucked and gave me some serious acid shits . you know the kind that feel like you are shooting fire out of your ass ?
i totally agree with some of the other reviews . i just do not get it . the food is not good and the service is terrible . they do have good bread but it is wildflower bread . i can go there for better food .
funugyz has the worst servers . the servers are rude and do not enjoy there jobs . do not go here it will be a disappointment for the experience .
this place is a rip off . very disappointing that this property has come to ripping vets off while claiming they are a nonprofit lodging facility for homeless vets . they do not just serve vets a good portion of their clients are not even vets .
just one step up from spirit . do n't waste your time or money unless you have nothing else to do for a week . all tickets are no . refundable .
do n't go here rude rude rude . horrible customer do bad i did not feel safe eating food and just threw it out
the most horrible food i ever tried wings were n't fresh but i ate few i got sick that night and vomit to morning i am highly recommend to avoid this place
the owner is rude . the pizza is just ok . very inconsistent quality . i would go to rosati 's instead .
horrible service . they sold me a broken pair of shoes and now refuse to exchange them for a new pair . my wife never wore the shoes . the broken buckle is from their associate . do not buy here .
horrible experience every time i go . the drive thru employees are always so rude ! today the lady got a attitude bc she asked me for 3 cent instead of breaking my cash i gave her . she was like take the dollar back .
the food tasted good , but the service was bad . we were also charged 15 per cent gratuity for having 6 people for lunch , however , there is no such info in the menu .
i will be happy to provide a review of their service if i can ever reach a live person to schedule an appointment with !
horrible drinks and horrible customer service . the vanilla lattes do not even have espresso . they are simply milk , water , ice , and flavoring . why advertise that foul tasting drink as a latte when it is n't ?
my husband and i just had dinner here and let me tell you we will not be back . .if you are craving authentic mexican food , do n't go here everything tasted very processed and out of a can and over priced for a small amount of food .
water was decent and the workers were friendly . everything else was intolerable and the food was inedible .
worst sandwich place ever i do n't know what came up we end up eating here soup is cold my salad was dry looks like my backyard weed the only this was good was my potato chips in the bag
worst service ever . they will make cheap replacements without warning you . american cheese has no place in indian food instead of accepting their mistake they made the same dish again using american cheese again except cut up smaller to try to hide it .
get ready to spend 55 $ to get in . let me break it down to you : its 20 $ to bribe to security guard to let you through so you can pay another fucking 35 $ to get in to the shittiest after hours spot in vegas .
i have never eaten here but just watched the video someone posted . and i have to ask - why do people in the food industry even bother to wear gloves if they do n't use them correctly ( i.e .
selling mussels that were half dead . i just bought a bag of mussels came home to wash and cook them . more then half were opened and dead leaving me with half a bag . i expect some to be dead as that 's normal but 20 .
frosting is way way too sweet and there is too much of it relative to the actual cupcake .
they are punctual and do a great job cleaning but they were supposed to provide proof of being licensed , bonded and insured and never did . definitely shady and my birth certificate was stolen from my desk so i am never using their service again !
small portions and high prices at an airport are expected . bait & switch are n't . heck , i was n't even paying and it still bugged me . went to the to go counter at 12:30 .
i 've honestly never had a good experience here . the waiters always seem to hate their jobs and the hostesses just stand there and watch tv .
it was n't bad but wtf they had a 4 year old girl behind the bar at 11 o'clock on a friday night ! i dunno about you but i do n't think that 's appropriate .
my mother and i had been going to ur nails since the new management took over about 10 years ago . we had always been treated with the best service until this last year .
meh . either pay for table service or do n't bother . the lack of a vip list on saturday nights leads to frustration that even the bouncers feel gross about .
i came here craving tacos on a friday night around 10:30 no tacos to be found at all . then i returned tonight a tuesday night around 9:30 no taco stand at all no where in sight .
very rude service . tries hard sell to get you to order more . tried to overcharge me in drive through . he did n't say thanks . he did n't say anything . just passed the food out the window and walks away . how rude .
i 've never waited longer for a bucket of fried chicken . the employees really could n't move any slower . we wo n't be back .
beware ! worst travel choice i have ever made . bought tickets thru a 3rd party . arrived at airport with a carefully planned 50 pound check bag ( note : every other airline is 50 pounds ) .
no , just no . my boyfriend and i came here for a late lunch . he ordered a chicken bahn mi because of the good reviews here and i got a chicken noodle soup . the bahn mi was dry and bland .
i made a reservation one day before we went there . but when we got there , they say there is no reservation . they confirmed that was their number i called , but they did n't write it down for reason .
did n't even submit insurance claim after giving them info and made me pay the 3000 in advance . called them multiple plan and still no submission to health care provider .
service is very slow , i received my milkshake in the drive-through and my milkshake is almost gone before i 've even receive my food .
updated review : note this review is not about the girls who work there , who i continue to maintain are very professional and good at what they do , my original review did give this place 4 stars and that still holds .
i was with the gym for only a year . i thought the owner was nice until i moved accross town and started going to a different location it was never kept clean or stocked there were cockroaches and bugs everywhere .
do n't know where to begin , guess the best thing there was the bottle of cheep wine which came with the groupon voucher . the salad bar and buffet were worse than in a cheap $ 7.99 hotel buffet and the meat was nothing special .
ok , so let 's start this properly . .food is an amazing 5 stars . .if you can ever get it . service in a word sucked '' and i never use that word about anyone because they are trying to earn a living .
this bank is a joke . they process each person slower than i have ever seen . ( literally the 2 in front if me have taken 15 minutes each ) .
you need to double check your order if you ever decide to go to this location . they do not know their own products , server blamed the the person making it saying they were new .
read jack l. 's review - had exactly the same experience . i do n't mind splurging , but lukewarm food and lukewarm service is not what you expect from a $ $ $ $ restaurant .
stopped in for a quick bite after flying in monday afternoon around 3pm . walked in , ordered , served quickly , drove away . the spicy chicken sandwich was so chewy it seemed to be more cartilage than meat .
ordered a few sandwiches delivery online and it took an hour and twenty minutes and they forgot one of our sandwiches . i called and told them and they told me they could n't deliver it even though i paid for delivery and they forgot it .
i really wish i could give this location 0 stars but they make you give it at least one to review . ok so this location is not that old a couple years , maybe 2 .
it 's walmart with even less redeeming qualities than the rest of them . seriously , imagine going into a walmart and all the staff either left or are on break .
most recently , i went through the drive through of this location with my friend . as she pulled up to the window , the younger male employee literally not only asked for her number but asked us if we had any weed .
pizza is ok we do n't get delivery because it takes too long customer service can be much better the one other reason i will never go back is when i ordered last week walked in and waited .
i keep giving this place a try , as i did today because no where else was open christmas day , but it 's just not that good .
weak tap beer line up . marginal service levels . cluttered sports '' pub . take a look at the layers of dust on all the helmets on display - now thats impressive ! why do people hold gatherings here ?
just had a terrible experience at this location . the food was ok . however , our waitress was the worst i 've ever had . she was confrontational when we asked her to fix an error she made on the bill .
my husband and i wanted to taste a vegas buffet and ended up here because it was cheaper than the ones on the strip . the buffet did not have a great selection and the food was so bland . there was nearly no meat on the crab legs .
they did not have the menu item from the web site i was really looking forward to . there was no indication it would not be available .
the post office at warren road is not only bad the mail service to the houses is also very bad .
receptionist is super rude ! we got a referral for this doctor and i called to make an appointment and ca n't believe how rudely she treated me , wish we did n't have to go here now . the staff at barrow are much nicer
today me and my wife ate here for the first and last time . were do i start .
i 've tried this place several times in high hopes it would be better than the time before . i 've had pizza , a calzone , and salad . the salad was actually good . the pizza was alright . the calzone was not good .
if you are even thinking about flying spirit airlines . think again please . my experience : - flight delayed 4 hours with little to no communication from staff .
5 of us sat down and ordered a shot and a beer . with us previously have not been drinking , the manager came up and said he was not gon na serve us hard liquor . we got up and left . have fun at this place !
i can not advise on if they have great massages or not at this location because i left 2 voicemail 's to set up an appointment and no one ever called me back .
i went here today for the first time after seeing pictures online . it looked cool so i wanted to check it out . i ordered two acai bows in a coconut . it came to $ 43 ! i think that is outrageous .
horrible experience here . a friend and i came here because we were staying at the riviera and it 's located downstairs . we initially came for coffee and a bagel in their cafe right outside their restaurant .
please note : if you are a vegetarian or vegan mcdonald 's puts beef flavoring in their fries and hash browns .
well , this was a bad choice for lunch. they always stress delivery , so we tried it at work .
very rude to have a band playing same time as sunday affair , will not be eating here unless they change this
this place is horrible and disgusting ! everything is gloomy and stained there was a cockroach in our room ! please choose any other place except this one !
aweful cut . come on now , my husband would have looked better if i 'd have done it ! for $ 25 we expect more . he even had to coach the barber to cut more hair and where to thin . wow train your team !
i hate this store . customer service is crummy . do n't expect to spend less than 1.5 hours just waiting for someone to help you and they wo n't make appointments either .
i called to schedule an appointment and ask a couple of questions prior to coming in . the lady who answered the phone was rude and not helpful at all .
i ordered a gorgeous carne asada salad ( at least the menu photo was pretty ) medium rare . what i got was over done tasteless plate of shredded meat on yellow lettuce . i sent the salad back untouched and lost my taste for anything different .
we rarely go to bk but today. we ordered cheetos fries . get tot the window and they did n't put it in the bag and the lady says it 's in there and asks for the bag back to double check . ''
i 've tried macarons all over the city and thought this place was cute when i walked in . they do n't actually make the macarons here , they are shipped from the u.s. and are assembled '' here . the dark haired woman is the owner 's wife .
i love chik fil a 's , but i was overwhelmed by a terrible smell when i walked in here today . gross . and the bathrooms were full and garbage overflowing . we walked out without ordering . this was from november 2012 .
absolutely terrible . i waited a outrageous 2-3 hours . for a small procedure that the dentist took 5-10 minutes to actually complete the time he was with me .
very pricy . a small latte costs $ 5.30 ! and it was supposed to be caramel overload but it was just horribly bitter ! the ambience maybe nice but never going back there .
came here for the first time with my family . i ordered ceviche and everyone 's plate came out except mine . waited and waited finally cancelled my order . wo n't be back to this place !
american airlines is by far the worst airlines i have ever encountered . traveling from nashville to bullhead city and american is the only airline flying into bullhead city . i had three connections going and three returning . four of the six flights have been delayed so far .
make sure you ask for napkins at the drive thru ! the morons working the window have n't figured out that drive thru customers might want napkins with their order yet .
nice place to eat , but for a delivery it 's really not my preferred place . very disappointed , got 3 pizzas that was very expensive for what i got , missing toppings and dough of one of them was n't even properly cooked
horrible ! went here for a mani pedi because their pricing is less expensive . i guess you get what you pay for ! i would advise people to pay that extra $ 10 and go elsewhere !
as a person who frequents this location , i really do n't have words for how poorly run it is . disappointed is understatement . i spend thousands of dollars at starbucks but am seriously considering becoming a dutch brothers customer .
i called this service when i lost my car keys . they came promptly and got into my car , but charged me $ 380 for one ignition key and one valet key .
when the person on the phone tells you to pull around back when you pick up the items , and you find out you actually have to go inside to get a contract , horrible .
would n't let me return with receipt and the store is pretty dirty and unorganized . i went to party city and they were cheaper .
our waiter was so rude . i ordered two chicken tacos , because mexican restaurants can be iffy . the chicken tacos were so nasty and stringy , i took one bite and left it there . my friend ordered beef tacos and she did n't eat hers either .
the fat , female sri lankan supervisor is very pushy on the cashiers to force people into signing up for the mastercard . all for a $ 1-4 commission for them .
wow , food is amazing but the customer service at this location is terrible ! drive to the other location on paradise . good customer service is worth the drive .
the cab driver recommended we go here for that true vegas club experience . well altho he was trying to be helpful , man was he waaaay off the mark . if this is a true vegas experience then erase my memory stat !
worst cleaning company ever . they never showed up to clean my house which i had an appointment for . i called them twice when they never showed up , the first time they said they would be there in one hr . one hour passed they never showed .
i took 2 thirteen year olds to shop at h & m . they were so excited , but that did n't last long . not one person greeted us ; not one clerk asked if we needed help .
i ordered two shots of espresso with extra ice and a small amount of ice coffee and they wanted to charge me for the ice coffee ?
consumers beware . do not visit this location . especially if you are a woman as the technicians '' ( where on earth do they get their training from ? ) bully you into getting services done , despite declining .
each time i 've gone there i have waited at least 20 minutes in the fast food lane . only to have cold food ! will never return . unacceptable .
i 'm so sad . i 've heard so many great things about this place , but their cheddar mac tasted like macaroni with butter . there was no cheese at all . maybe you need to eat it there , but heated up was tasteless . too bad .
apparently las vegas does not have tacos at there burger king . i stood in line and when it was my turned i ordered 4 tacos and the girl looked at me as though i was crazy .
before joining this gym , do a google search and you will find they have a track record of scamming their members . on the plus side , it 's probably the cheapest gym in town . there are all sorts of machines and they are usually available .
i went there at 4:30am and the service is suck the guy who has beard . , he is not friendly , the way he talk he cant even open his mouth while he ask u what type of bread .
i had expected from a place that specialized in them . we ordered brunch items , and they were good , but quite over priced in my opinion . we spent $ 75 for breakfast for my little family of four .
i was so excited for this trip from las vegas to oakland .
omg what a terrible effin ' restaurant .
worst apartment complex i have ever lived in . first off i paid my rent , a day late . and they charged me 400 $ in late fees and did n't tell me . then they evicted me and my spouse .
i had loved this place ( read my earlier review ) . however , they have been trying too hard to the point of being pretentious .
the absolute worst service in las vegas . it was horrible . the server was rude . the hostess rolled her eyes at me when i asked her a question . i paid over $ 500 for a horrible experience with mediocre sushi .
i wish i could give a better rating being as though i am a brand new tenant as of only a week , but all i can say is that the reviews on facebook and elsewhere are legitimate .
my husband and i ate lunch here today . we got a buffalo chicken wrap which was not very good and smoothies . there were two people sitting at the bar that seemed to be friends with one of the workers .
i had high hopes for this place after reading the reviews but i was terribly disappointed . i was with eight friends on a wednesday night and we sat at two table pushed together .
the five guys on central ave have a cook with a nasty beard cooking the food with no beard cover it is terrible made me not want anything
this place is no longer in business , but the building is occupied by the restaurant the place ''
has to be one of the worst companies i 've dealt with online and over the phone . placed an order on 1 21 2016 . i ordered 2 key fobs and a replacement key . first call was about a week after order placed .
my wife told me one morning that she wanted to see the nutcracker in seattle , and i made the mistake of going online before i had enough coffee .
while the ambiance begins to hint at a football game , it stops way too soon . i mention the ambiance before the food b c the food is that lackluster . plain . big thumbs up for small business , local business .
i took my puppy to this banfield a couple months ago . the whole experience was bad . they made us wait almost one hour ( i had an appointment ) , then a lady doctor showed up . she was nice but not reliable enough .
any other native is better than this one . bad service and bad food 4 times in a row . i 'm close to this one so i keep giving them a chance but after today i 'm done .
roaches ! we went to tandoori flame last night . they seem like they are under staffed . it 's very difficult to get a waiters attention to clear plates or even ask for water .
the wait was too long . i think any local such as i , will agree that bachi burger is way better and way cheaper as far as fancy burgers go that is . food isnt bad but just not worth the money and the experience .
the absolute nastiest young girl at the front taking money to come in . her big mouth talking rude to costumers as they come in smh ! they should fire her and hire someone with a better ability to talk to adults .
as if waiting in the long line due to employee lag time is not bad enough , you have to wait in a facility with no ac . the employees work as slowly as possible and do not make efficient use of their time .
8 months later and my cats teeth gums are just fine despite our not believing gentle doctor 's crooked lying vet . gd tried pulling 3 of my poor cats teeth out for $ 900 but i would n't let them .
went in one day to look around , kind of asked about the helicopters the lady was not helpful at all and pretty much ignored me as if i didnt belong there . she also told me these were complex '' and that was the end of our conversation .
got ta say not really a fan . went to see a movie today and was disappointed in how uncomfortable and close the seats are ! felt like we were on an airplane or train . no personal space .
i came here last night , not much i was looking for , they did n't have much i was looking for i ended up buying a pillow that i end up returning .
terrible customer service . i called 4 times , had to leave messages every time , and never once received a call back .
apparently i have struck a nerve with someone as he has called me an idiot . i did not realize that if i left my opinion in my food for that day someone named jeff would stoop to such a level .
i had the worst experience at this salon . walked in was going to get a manicure and pedicure . first a man was working on my feet someone came in he stopped what he was doing and started to do her nails . i was confused .
well , i guess i was n't the only one who did n't like it ! well i for sure wont be visiting this place anymore !
well , here i am trying to write a review for a pizza that still is n't here . ordered it 90 minutes ago . calls to the place for the last 45 minutes have received a it 's on its way '' remark .
this place is horrible , ( aka ramada ) if you are planning to stay during spring training or through triple crown sports , do n't !
my food was terrible . ordered chicken nuggets and french fries . chicken nuggets were cold , and gross because they 've probably been sitting out for 4 hours . my french fries . total joke .
was very much disappointed , was waiting for 40 minutes for food that never came . asked for a refund and left .
i called because i just heard about this place . he answered the phone and i asked if he was hiring . he said , we only hire customers that always come in . '' something along those lines . and he hung up on me .
i was looking forward to going back . now i am not so sure i want to ever go back . website and the sign on the door posted hours they should have been open last sunday . gate was open , door was locked .
i found a sharp shard of glass in my salad and they still tried to charge me for it . aside from glass in my mouth , the food was just ok .
for an airport restaurant , i have never had such horrible service . luckily we had extra time before our flight or we never would have made it . waited 20 minutes for our order to be taken and another 10 minutes for our drinks .
they had a decent carry out special on a small one topping for 5.00 including tax but they just raised the price 20 and it 's no longer worth the price for a mediocre pizza .
the food was awful , the service was worse and i was sorry that out of all the places to go in that area we chose this one . it was not my choice and will never be the choice of anyone in our family again .
the clothes are ok for the price . i come in here if i need a tank top or something quick and i would shop here more often if the service was better . the people are awful to communicate with .
very disappointed . warning . worse than proverbial used car sales man . i purchased personal training sessions ( of course under contract for one year ) . i did not use them all and wanted to cancel the contract .
the manager here is an idiot this guy has an ego way to big for his own good . the food is good but over priced but because of management i will never return .
f- this was the worst flight i have ever taken , read the reviews before you book a flight with these guys .
many negatives here : 1 ) prices are very high , unless you have a huge account and special pricing they are not competitive with other metal sellers in the area . 2 ) they are not locally owned this is a corporate store with headquarters in ca .
terrible service . the wait was ridiculous . service was awful . paid too much for a tiny car . tried to contact them 2 hours after we picked up the car , no one answered the phone . we left a message no call back .
wow , i never would have expected a hotel this dirty and unsanitary . i am not one to be picky when getting a cheap hotel , but holy smokes was this place nasty .
this was one place i wanted to try before i left las vegas . i went here for breakfast and was disappointed . i was only the second customer in the restaurant and ordered a basic breakfast of eggs , potatoes , bacon , and toast .
only one in the restaurant at 5:40 pm . maybe 6 people total by the time i left at 6:30 including one loner guy at the bar smoking an e-cig as if he was cool somehow .
do n't believe anything the other reviews say . holy crap . a co worker and i went to the restaurant to take advantage of their online order option , express dine-in '' . worst . idea . ever .
absolute garbage . the only taxi service available at pearson and all fairs are a minimum $ 21 . i literally went 3 minutes to the marriott hotel and was charged $ 21 .
if you 're thinking of buying of gift for someone here do n't . unlike most stores these days they do not take returns only exchanges . my husband bought me an expensive bag here which i really did n't like .
we were flying in to glendale airport on saturday and my wife reserved a car for us to be picked up at the airport .
i enjoy mcdonalds coffee in canada , it rivals tim hortons . even the tea is good . i tried once twice and 3 times in phoenix and the coffee was brown hot and no flavour to be had . the worst coffee i ever had .
typical mcdonald 's . they open whenever they want , serve food that 's hours old , and pretend the ca n't hear you through the drive thru mic .
slow slow slow ! they looked confused . 30 minutes for a small cone and small oreo blizzard .
have you ever had leftover chinese delivery that was n't even worth saving ? i did n't know this was possible until i ordered from this restaurant . i ordered because they left menus around my apartment complex and i have been looking for decent chinese food delivery .
if there 's a way i can give 0 stars , i would . this is the most awful vietnamese place i 've ever been to . they use a microwave to cook food and far too much sugar and salt .
very disappointing experience . we were planning a family day and were very excited to do this as a family because that is what it said on their website and on the groupon we purchased .
horrible , horrible , horrible . i should 've known this place was bad when i booked the room for like $ 60 a night over the weekend . thought i was getting a steal . not .
i do n't know what happened to this place . i bought glasses there 5 years ago and they were great . this time , they remade them 5 times and they 're still horrible . i 've wasted too much time to go back there again .
so the manager never contacted me about my horrible experiences at the gerrard square home depot . you deserve no stars gerrard square home depot . save yourself the trouble and go to the north york location or the scarborough location .
this place is a joke . terrible customer service on the phone and when we order delivery it 's a two hour wait . this is the second time we experienced this . it 's like they do n't want us to buy their pizza .
one star for the wait staff . ate lunch there on a thursday ; had a blt sandwich and cream of broccoli soup . the soup tasted funny so they replaced with chicken soup which tasted a lot like campbell 's soup .
last time i ordered they messed up my pizza order , so i called back and the manager told me that next time i ordered i would get a pizza for free .
this place should be closed down ; demolished . turned into a fatburger . the sales associates are unfriendly , do n't know how to work their own machines ( do n't bother asking for a key to be made ) .
stopped in early on a thursday night . the staff was dismissive . they change the prices on drinks by a dollar here and there . someone is skimming the till . the pole dancers sucked too .
i organized a group event and had an awful experience . a staff member gave me a tour a month before the event . we reserved a date , confirmed the type of function , the range of people we can expect and the associated price .
lunch is super crowded here always and seems understaffed as it was today . but it was exceptionally slow today . im so glad my boss is not around to see how long i was gone for lunch ! had to get my soda from the host .
visiting from ft. lauderdale came here to experience the original primantis and what a disappointment . 3 people running the whole place we sat at the counter 30 minutes and . it even a hello or a glass of water .
ordered pizza tonight at 7pm . it is now 9:05 and the pizza still has n't been delivered . on top of that every time i try to call the store they hang up on me . corporate needs to get involved with this location .
i do n't usually do this and the guy was nice enough but i should have taken the empty place as a sign . the worst under cooked veggie burger and fries i 've ever had . homemade ketchup '' is a water tomato concoction .
thiefs , crooks , scam artist ! i have multiple friends and my deceased father from the construction world and am shocked at how crooked shane and this company are ! it all started with a leak behind walls in the kitchen .
$ 6 fee to cash check drawn on chase acct ?
we called in our prescription 2 hours prior , once we got to cvs at 3:05 am , we had to wait another 20 minutes . slow system . richard was a nice guy , it was n't his fault .
i made the mistake of reserving a u-haul truck through barry 's true value .
worst service in greater toronto ! i booked a reservation for 4 people . we walked in and i literally stood in front of the hostess for 10 minutes before being greeted .
simply the worst customer service i have experienced in a long time . very easy to sign up . extremely difficult to cancel their services . they do not provide an id number to track my cancellation and kept charging my credit card .
what a disgusting restaurant ! 4 people in our group ordered the shepherd 's pie . 3 of the 4 were cold . the dish looks like canned dog food swimming in a pool of flavorless yellow crap .
worst starbucks ever . barista spent her time chatting up a boy and making other customers wait . for a long time . totally inept .
i would never recommend this place to anyone . i had the worst experience with the entire staff . they just want your money , not to help you when you 're sick .
one of those times when you have to make an account simply to let people know about how rude a staff member can be . if you are looking for customer service go elsewhere .
disgusting ! new owner , new cook , awfully cooked food ! we could n't eat the food because it tasted so bad ! we walked away . very disappointing !
i would never uses these guys ! their hose broke and blew water all over my tv . the guy was n't even going to tell me , luckily my cleaning lady was here to get my attention .
in the running for one of the worst restaurants in pittsburgh . if it 's your first time in the city , please do n't go here . looks great from the outside but everything else about it is terrible .
never fails when there is a new set of staff they have terrible service , its wasnt even a rush and my tacos were made so sloppy i wanted to say nevermind i dont even want them . i was cheated out of rice .
went to drive time , they came up with an outlandish price that the car was n't worth . wanted me to pay way over my budget .
the only thing going for this place is the beer selection and the waitstaff . the brisket was pretty much like beef jerky with no flavor .
i went in to use the restroom and i was horrified . each stall not only was out of seat covers , out of tissue , the trash cans were over flowing and in the top of the cans were tissue with human waste on it .
unbelievable ! we order my mom , which is dying of cancer some edible arrangements '' for valentines day , hoping it would bring a smile to her face !
the only positive experience i had was my initial visit . the doctor i met with , jillian webb , was nice and made me feel very comfortable when speaking to her . since then , it 's been a nightmare .
this is a horrible place the food was gross and now i 'm sick and i mean sick ! i ca n't even get out of bed from food poisoning . i hate chain restaurants just went there because someone in the family insisted on going there .
i would n't even give them one star really . have been bake twice , asking for something vegan ( which they are supposed to have ) ok the first time i did n't investigate enough , came on the wrong day . have to go on friday .
yikes . dinesafe has temporarily closed this place due to 12 infractions of dining safe codes . this is not good . i will not be checking this place out for a while even after it reopens assuming it will reopen .
terrible drive thru , orders are never right . three times now we have gotten home to find only buns , missing everything in between , or totally wrong items . wo n't be returning to this location !
first of all i been a loyal cora customer , i been coming to them almost every other sunday with my family went here last sunday . the service overall was pretty bad . waitress was super rude and was rushing us to order .
this is my local gas station . it would be my favorite if they cared about , and would listen to their customers . i 've walked in to make purchases . i 'm usually met with next register . this one 's closed '' . nice huh ?
i would have to agree with the initial review of this place . came in today for a standard oil change in their express service . they called and said the air filter and cabinet filter needed replacing .
called in to inquire about a t or m t tires and possible wheels for my 2017 4runner . the guy who picked up the phone said my phone was producing static . before i can say anything , i heard the click '' as he hung up .
this place sucks ! i placed an order for a cab 12:45 . made the call at 11:15 . been calling the dispatch for about a half an hour and she wo n't pick-up . never using this company again . avoid th
my insurance company , geico , booked me for an appointment at a safelite shop late afternoon the following day .
would n't recommend , this place is all about making money . it 's not about helping people with hearing loss , do n't be fooled .
first impressions are important and these guys blew it .
worst kfc ever do n't go here ! awful customer service . we went to the drive thru and the employee acted like she did n't know the menu . rude we had to repeat our order 3 times we decided to leave
i dine out frequently , particularly on sundays after church with my family . stone mountain grill ruined one such sunday for my family . the food was generic .
walmart is about as low as it gets . just how stupid are people ? do you really want the cheapest crap you can get on the planet ? the cheapest car , home , girlfriend , etc. '' dirt is cheap -- have at it !
wish i could give zero stars ! the furry nation has a unique selection of pet products , but that 's the extent of the good news . the mark-up on certain items is outrageous and the store always appears to be in a state of chaos .
why do i keep falling into this hellhole ? 4 times , yes , 4 , the most i chances i have given a place . either they : a ) are out of whatever you want . b ) have bad attitudes .
i took my dog to this vet because it was recommended to me by a coworker , and my dog had been coughing for a week .
although the driver was very kind . charging me the same price when you do n't have a topping ? saying you called the number listed with no response and i have no missed calls .
i bought a groupon deal and made a reservation online ahead of time , since it was christmas time i knew it would be busy and wanted to ensure that i had a spot to park .
i have been going to this cvs for the past 4 years , and i consistently get poor service from the pharmacy . my questions and concerns are usually met with rudeness and incompetence .
they completely rush you when you get a pedi mani combo and the end result is borderline decent . i only tolerated this place because it 's conveniently located near my house . however , today 's experience showed me differently .
waited 40 minutes for mediocre food . i watched the kitchen staff smell an avocado to determine if it was still good '' . the staff were inattentive and poor communicators . this could be a great neighborhood hang .
do not go here ! this place has to be the worst damn company in the entire city ! i cant even pick one bad thing because there are so many to choose from !
i was devastated when i built a bond with larry the lobster and as i was waiting the chef came to the front and took him right from the tank . .i left immediately .
terrible ! do not waste your time . she have n't filed my nails in a normal way , did n't know how to do mani in general . i have posted some pictures there so you can see she did n't know hot to apply nail polish .
if i could give this bank and over all rating - it would be zero ! they tell you , that because of your credit issue '' ( regardless of if you have any ) that you 'll be put on an opportunity account '' .
this company is a nightmare to deal with ! they do not return phone calls , and all you get is a run around when trying to get a deposit back . very unprofessional . take your business elsewhere !
if i could rate no stars i would . the hotel is filthy . they do n't attempt to mask the dirt in the lobby and elevators . the hallways look as if they have n't been vacuumed . the rooms are dirty .
the food is too expensive . the portions are n't very good for the price . across the street is panda express which is about the same amount of food , cheaper and has a drive-thru .
tried to up-sell us on service we did n't need when we went in for brakes ( the brake job was fine , though ) .
my last visit at home depot . i 'm so confused as to why they did n't put me the customer first . this is my second visit to resolve an issue . instead of providing a solution for me they were rude and unaccommodating .
for $ 50 for a six inch salted caramel cake , we were quite disappointed .
friendly staff , but stops there . the course is in horrendous shape and the worst greens i 've played in my entire life . the ground is very hard and finding a good patch of grass , even on the fairway is a miracle .
awful ! i will never eat here again . the place closes at 10:30 and my mom and i went a little before 9:00 . the food was cold , i had to ask several times for sushi to be made .
tried lunch . salad over dressed . sandwich missing sauce noted on menu . service very slow given only three tables occupied . ca n't recommend .
i wish i could give this walgreens pharmacy a negative star review . the customer service here is horrible . i was rushed and made to feel like a complete pain in the ass because they had to put my insurance card in .
one of my clients recommended this place so i decided to give it a try .
not having someone to override transaction '' on duty to fix a simple credit card charge error is not a great service for a big franchise .
i have had amazing times with this company ! when i first purchased my rims they were amazing , then they switched management and it 's been downhill from there !
last night was my first experience at this salon and i will never be back ! although my toes look pretty the customer service sucked and the salon was n't very clean . i was there for 2.5 hours for a pedicure !
visiting charlotte and came here today upon a friend 's recommendation . total disappointment ! for 15 $ , i got to wait 1 hr and then spend 10 minutes with the blond lady ( the other two were n't working today ) .
i 'm sitting here watching them not clean my cuticles after i asked them to redo it . definitely wo n't be coming back here . how did this place get 4 stars ?
horrible drive thru service . tried to pick up food for my co-workers and they told me i could only make two separate orders . i asked if i could drive thru a separate time and the lady was very rude and told me they do n't allow that !
poor bussing of tables . strange behavior among wait staff ! manager called to inform her about all the food on seats ! all she said was that she 'll mention it to the bussers . no one is smiling ! lines are picking up !
two words : bad service . here 's a tip to management : be careful what kind of employees you hire . when there are tons of students looking for work during the summer , you may want to be diligent in screening the candidates .
i was referred by my pcp to dr fairfax . it took me 4 months to get an appointment . i saw him a total of 3 times for arthritis issues . he requested blood work & mris during these visits , did not prescribe meds or order treatment .
drove three hours to find the car they told us about was not there . the guy on the lot was unprepared to give us details on other vehicles or even find the keys .
the price is too high for the amount of food you receive , if you cater often consider ordering twice as much as you would normally need from another company . never using them again !
$ 5 for a $ 3 wash somewhere else . thing is , we left with soap still on our car when we left . i do not recommend for this reason . we also heard 2 loud bangs on our car , although saw no dents .
been resident for a couple years . have n't moved only because moving is a hassle ! office system was down during contract renewal . they charged us month to month fee which was brought to their attention . they said someone would call .
there are few times in life in which you have the opportunity to truly wonder where the hidden cameras are . if you are interested in reaching your destination , use another airline . any other airline .
worst mcdonald 's i 've ever came across . it 's close to my home so i do visit every once in awhile but i never have a good experience .
horrible customer service . takes 20 minutes just for them to print something out . employees are rude and do n't even acknowledge you when you walk up to them . wo n't be coming back here .
will never go back to this place . i get my nails done on a very regular basis . no matter if i have a lot of money or a little , i find a way to get my nails done .
avoid this location at all costs . they are impatient , mess up orders , and are downright rude and unapologetic .
lucky cab driver charged us $ 34 from las vegas airport to our hotel on las vegas blvd . the way back with another cab service only cost $ 12 .
went there yesterday after being there once about 6 years back . do not order from the so called italian menu it is garbage no flavour what so ever !
let 's start with what was good . ok , now that we covered that , the food and the drinks were abysmal . really , the worst food i 've had in decades .
this store is closed ! inventory was seized for non-payment of rent . really ? how does a thrift store go out of business ?
this place is ridiculous do not go here . i started invisalign in 2011 . they entered everything into my insurance asap and i paid in full my portion that was left over .
i got a quick manicure done at this place and it has been the worst experience yet . it 's inexpensive for a reason . although the staff was friendly at first , the man who did my manicure was aggressive with my nails .
i was in an event on last tuesday in this center . it was very terrible sound system . a lot of people were unhappy : ( ( (
do n't stop here they will be out of whatever your looking for ! worst gas station ever ! always out of cigarettes and chew . i mean how hard is it to order and keep tobacco stocked ? every week they are out !
do not come here . it 's a gay bar and they discriminate .
i went here for lunch one day with a co worker , and was not impressed . we sat at the bar , hoping to get faster service , since we were on a time schedule .
i only gave them a one star since zero is n't an option . after reading the reviews i noticed others had the same problem i did . i paid for a year , no problems the entire time .
my kid loves -- loves -- bruegger 's bagels . so , we come here a lot . but we 're gon na have to change that because this store is inexcusably slow .
i do not have good things to say about this overpriced drive thru . i dont get the obsession with it . the food is not good . i have had 3 salads they all sucked . how you order through the drive thru is weird .
server barely said 10 words the whole time we were there . the food was absolutely shameful ! stale stale stale . when they set the chips and salsa down you could actually smell the stale chips . should have left then .
this location really gives bagel places a bad name . i do n't know why i continue to keep trying and going back to this establishment . probably because it is right across the street from work .
i went for taco tues. and was very disappointed . the fish tacos had overly fried fish sticks in them . the chicken tacos must have had canned chicken in them . the ground beef tacos had a lot of black stuff in them .
i went here using a groupon , after my boyfriend had told me this used to be his favorite restaurant . used to be . not anymore !
ordered a few times from here . food was great each time . last time it took a bit longer than usual ( about 55 minutes ) this time we waited an hour and checked what was going on , they said the driver was on the way .
most disgusting chicken taco ever ! tasted like fish ! avoid this place !
small variety of food and food was not so good . waste of money ! now i know for next time .
i had n't been to a dunkin ' donuts in awhile until today . now i know why . if you want fresh donuts , go to one of the other options nearby .
stopped here before the pirate game . not busy and the patio had some empty seats . sat down and waited on promptly . all down hill from there . beer was warm . service was horrible at best . 1 hr for the food to come .
tried this location tonight . the service was slow and they messed up our order multiple times . i really like oreganos so this time around makes me very sad .
this store is always full of trash and it 's hard to believe they specialize in kids and babies with how filthy everything is here . we also found sodas in the checkout line refrigerator were expired .
the last macaroni grill that i ate at was back in 2008 with my boyfriend ( now husband ) and we loved it . the atmosphere was great and it was reasonably priced .
my wife and i have been here before and it was good . this time was a horrible experience . our waitress rang in the order no big deal people make mistakes . she did own up to it .
the oven stopped working and i needed someone to take a look .
none of the employees here wear gloves . i watch a employee come straight from the back room to the cook line and start cooking with his bare hands . i will and recommended that you never go to this jack in the box .
if you like yuppies and hipsters , then this is your joint . if you want a nice place to have a beer where you do n't have to take off your hat to be served , keep walking .
looks like they are trying to hard to create an asian fusion type of restaurant . disappointed in the food prep and quality . ordered the pad thai and gyoza . did n't finish either of the two .
received a fraudulent bill from this company today at the small business i work for , we have never conducted business . in agreement with everyone else 's posts here , do not pass go and collect $ 200 . do n't pay .
do not ever order from here . customer service sucks . ordered to go and it never came . i called to see what happened to our order and the lady who answered the phone was rude . do n't even waste your time ordering from here .
one of the worst restaurants i 've ever been to . the food was the bland . the only thing decent was the hush puppies . the owner made us feel very uncomfortable . he made some inappropriate jokes . our waitress was good though .
every time i come here i wait in line forever . they do n't have enough people working here . time to find a new fabric store .
have been there a few times . about 1 2 the time the pizza is cold when i get home . this time i told them what time i would be there so the pizza would be done and hot about the time i got there .
definitely the worst experience i 've ever had renting from someone .
i started working in the mall , so decided to try - what a mistake - i been sick now since i ate there on thurs . ruined my weekend plans . i 'm never eating there again , or anything in the food court .
horrible customer service . spoke to two different people in one day . one was a manager . nicole ? super rude .
eyebrow service was awesome . eyelashes where horrible . they were spaced out , looked like i had them for 3 weeks already . glue caked up on top and bottom . took them off 10 mins after i left salon .
i would never go back here . the old man behind the counter was rude . he asked me for id and a card . i told him i just need a $ 19.95 for a day , did n't get any explanation of milage .
i really like this place , however tonight was the worst service we have had in a while .
i am not sure if these guys are dishonest or extremely unorganized but either way if you use them be sure to get a written estimate with all costs and work to be done clearly explained .
for being panda , i expected better ! on the strip , i expected better . the steamed brown rice was underdone . crunchy . the string bean chicken. beans were freezer burned , the dish was old and tasted of smoke .
not safe .
i do n't know why and when they closed this restaurant . but i lost my favorite chinese restaurant in that area .
every single time i have come to this location i have experienced some sort of problem . whether it 's incompetent employees , messed up orders , or payment systems being down , this location never fails to produce horrible customer service .
appointment was made for 2:00pm and my friend and i sat in pedicure chairs with our feet in cold water for 40 minutes before we were helped .
worst bank in the valley ! especially the arrowhead location . first fidelity is riding on the coat tails of sunrise and mesa bank which were what they advertised small community banks '' . worst customer service !
it was my first time there . the cashier did n't explain anything . i was asking lots of questions , and he just told me to pick . so , i did . he then took my payment . i asked how it worked .
i wish there was a way i can leave no stars . horrible horrible experience here . my boyfriend and i went to the bar after playing a couple of games to order drinks & the bartender was horribly rude .
drove 15 mins one way to get to this place . it was my first time trying their food , once i ate the food i have to say i was disappointed . food needed more flavor , tofu was way too soft to where the texture was soggy .
place is locked when it got the open sign on . and you have to ring the doorbell in order to get in there . no thanks , that 's pretty weird . there 's no window , just a garage door .
better to be homeless than trust these crooks . bruce should be in jail . they constantly took advantage of me and my roommates . they literally stole from us .
i work and live in the area and thought this would be a great place to chill and enjoy a frozen treat . now that its been open a few months i have to admit that i was wrong .
this place is horrible ! if you 're the only client there they take their time . as soon as someone walks in they start to rush to get to the next client .
undoubtedly the worst car wash i have ever been to . was there last week as i was leaving town on a trip so no time to go back then to tell them they missed the dashboard , console and the entire back end of my suv .
not satisfied with their parking spot rent service at all ! i needed a parking spot near university and so i rented one from them .
we just went there because its my sons bday and left because 1st of all when we enter the lady didnt even smile she ask us how many ? she grab the menu and didnt even call us . my son just followed her .
called the local store and they said they had what we wanted in stock for a certain price .
the staff here are very rude . i 've never experienced such treatment . was hoping the products would at least live up to the hype but everything is extremely overpriced for what it is .
worst harris teeter ever 30 minutes to check out and still waiting under staffed and rude workers and 17.00 for a salad ? better off at food lion and i never thought i would say that
i have been to this location on three separate occasions and i have had a horrible customer service experience everytime .
first time at this rest . and there was a cockroach on the wall and there tacos were n't even good . -_-
bought 2 keys through amazon , would not program , tried 2 locksmiths , their keys programmed right up ! contact them , asked for picture , after no replies back , asked for refund , told that since keys are cut they ca n't refund me ?
the chicken salad was bad just it was more lettuce than anything else . at least out cucumbers there are more veggies
had their all you can eat sushi . worst dining experience in vegas . do not waste your money here . food is substandard and service is slow .
went to see about some dogs to adopt and never received a call back ! so thankful we found another place to find our dog .
do n't go to the chandler kfc location on chandler blvd . cashier very rude i just asked for refund manager did n't care never said sorry young kids working there . place was very dirty bad bad place
unprofessional ( both the owner and his son ) . i have never been treated like that , the owner is so rude and he literally yelled at me , because i left whereas i had been waiting for 25 minutes just to check out .
told myself i would never go back to ihop , but this one is the worst in service , went there for breakfast and waited 15 min before the hostess that seated me asked me if i had been helped !
i took my two-year-old son into get his second haircut . we would 've taken him to the first place he had been to but they did n't have any openings . so we figured we would give fantastic sams a try .
usually have good luck with this store , but not this time . poor customer service this time . they were out of stock of what i went in for . did n't offer to call other stores . i had to ask for the number .
so this is a good looking place , but as a current student this place is hell ! if you are looking for a school to attend this is not the place to go . they dnt have there shit together all this school cares about is making money .
i ordered the family special for $ 25 and ordered the beef broccoli , orange chicken and it came with cream cheese rangoons , egg flower soup and egg roll .
so me and judy were in las vegas and were trying to get a quick bite to eat before we had to get our sister ready for the wedding . we stumbled onto this place and were kinda iffy '' about it .
i stayed here years ago and it was great but the new contractor management is terrible . cold water is unavailable in summer months and internet does not work . when i asked to switch rooms management refused . i recommend staying off base of at all possible .
this place just needs to be shut down . the owner is a jerk and will give you attitude throughout your order or even talk on the phone while he puts your order in .
came by at 3:30 pm and it was closed even though it says it is open right now on yelp and their site says this location is still open , the lights were off and the gate closed . it may no longer be in business !
if i could say no stars i would . we lost my niece , who was 11 , and they made the process so much harder . they were unprofessional , rude and extremely difficult to deal with .
an update . as you can see , joshua or john ( not sure who he is since his name is one and email is the other ) left me a yelp reply from this shady dealership .
this will never be a shopping destination , for me ! unless i need to visit the apple store , i 'm staying away . for the most part , the center is a collection of over priced restaurants and clubs .
the staff was very rude . we went 15 minutes prior to closing time we were let inside the store but were asked to leave as they said time is over . very bad customer service .
worst sprouts in the valley . the produce department is always fruit fly city . it 's seems the never rotate it because as you search for one good one , you discover a plethora of rot at the bottom .
this place is a pain every time i go on . nothing but issues with their point reward systems . i have points for a drink but every time i go to redeem it 's another reason why i ca n't .
dear panera it wo n't kill you to serve better portions . giving this place a one star because apparently 1 2 a sandwich is less than 1 2 of what an actual sandwich is suppose to be . not to mention my broccoli cheddar soup was cold .
if i could give this place a half a star , that would be too much . dave was the jerk who helped '' us in his arrogant manner . nothing he said made any sense about the plans .
the $ 56 ribeye i ate here was on par with your local outback steakhouse . i 'm a scientist and foodie , and not prone to exaggeration nor opposed to spending a lot for a good meal .
i used to be a big fan . the parking lot was a little hectic during rush hour but worth it . recently though i had to stop coming because certain dishes that were marked veggie triggered my allergic reaction . twice it happened .
do not even think about coming to this cafe '' . first i tried to order an italian wrap , which they were out of , so i asked for a turkey wrap which was old and mushy .
it is very hard to find a good baker specialized in italian pastries in phoenix .
do not rent here . the management is mean to the tenants and find it fun to pit them against each other by gossiping .
i thought since they emailed me sincerely i would give them another review . i was promised a no hassle experience without a load of stupid add-ons tacked onto the car . i got hassle and i got add-ons .
this was the first ( and last ) time we had eaten at this restaurant . we were at the orleans and thought we would try it out ( since tgi fridays had a long wait ) .
appalled with their service . i have been using their service for about 2months and it seemed to be adequate . this week i pulled the tag from a pair of pants and put them on and noticed something all over the front that looks like glue .
i tried four different massage therapists at massage envy on camelback , in phoenix and was not happy with any of them ! one lady talked so much and i do n't mind that but she stops massaging when she talks .
yes this post office is always busy and people in line complain while they wait . does n't change the wait time just makes for entertainment listening to the agitated .
do not use this place ! took in a watch which had not been used awhile for a battery change . to make long story short , the surface of watch became brown in a spot .
this is the most horrible foot massage i have ever been . me and my husband went there today for 1 hour session , and both of us did n't enjoy our massage .
this has got to be one of the worst experiences i have ever had at an arizona hair company . the girl that cut my hair had a hard time cutting it short .
fast food is supposed to be just that . every time i go to a panda express they are always out of some dish . it 's not like there is a rush either , this store has very view customers right now .
very disappointed - had an appointment set up to provide an estimate on bathroom remodel - no call , no show . i called to check on status , and they apparently forgot about me .
they gave the wrong pizza and refused to give the correct one . manager was impolite .
i 'm giving this rating based off of the customer service . my boyfriend and i went here because we had never been before and the spicy teriyaki caught our eye . we go up and the cashier was friendly and took our order .
never even been here . i was shopping for a bike at landis and asked the wifey to go outside and call bb to price shop a similar bike .
once again having issues with this dealership and i have been out of the shitty car i purchased from this dealership for 2 months now .
tried to call both phone numbers 3 times and no one answers . tried to email them from website and they do n't have email posted . they litter our apartment community with flyers and they are all over ! we have asked them to stop .
terrible . i had a baby dress ( never worn other than to try on ) that was too small for my daughter .
absolutely disgusting . the restaurant is so dirty and you can tell they try to mask the flavour of the nasty chicken with the sauces .
me and my boyfriend come here often but after being greeted '' by the super rude employees that were there , never again will we come again .
just had the worst fast food experience . the staff here is horrific . we waited in line to order , with 1 car in front of us , for 15 minutes .
they are a complete scam . sat through their seminar . they literally blocked the exit and prevented me from leaving .
this is not a complaint against just this particular walmart ! consumers beware ! i believed their ads about cashing checks for $ 3 each .
anthony 's glass was extremely poor and unprofessional . i made an appointment on friday for saturday afternoon between two and four o'clock .
smells like sewer inside and out . waitress was rude and behind . manager started serving tables that came in well after me .
went this morning to get the inside of my car cleaned and to get the salt rinsed off from the snow storm . make sure you check behind these guys .
really now ? there mold in the meats have you guys checked that recently ? rice is old and soggy . plates are barely cleaned . not what i expected when it comes to fine '' dining .
nothing special . better options in town for less money . sides tasted like they 'd come from a very familiar country fried chicken '' fast food operation . wo n't be going back .
garbage . they run through this whole spiel how you should n't have to pay for anything unless you are signed , then after you are signed it 's ok to pay for head shots . guess what ?
we were planning a trip to toronto and booked with soul mutts weeks ahead of time to pick up our dog for day care while we went out for the day .
if you are thinking of coming here , dont . i used to be an avid customer , however their service started to decline back in june july . i do n't know what changed .
i 've been waiting am hour so far . still in waiting room have n't even made it to the back yet . i am now in the back still waiting . .1 hour 25 minutes and have n't seen the dr yet
went for a simple order , yet the cashier still screwed it up . then , the burger i ordered was nasty tasting . took two bites of it , and threw the rest to some stray cats . even they did n't eat the damn thing .
taco bell is getting ridiculous ! i just went there got the new loaded taco burrito and it had such a skimpy amount of meat . nothing like what they put in the pictures or on tv .
i cant never get anyone on the phone and when i get through people are just rude . this office is not professional at all and everyone seems to hate their jobs
my experience was horrible , we asked for a king and we got 2 full size beds , the hallway smelled like marijuana pretty bad , the second room had a horrible cigarette smell to it .
i went to spring nails for the first time with a friend to get pedicures . the attendant who was preparing my feet for my pedicure was extremely rude and unprofessional .
thanks starbucks for the heavy ice when i asked for light ice . literally paid 6 bucks for a venti and did n't even get 10 sips out of it . smh . perfect way to get money outta people huh ?
i was brought up in a mexican household . i gave tia rosas one star because i just was n't impressed with the food authenticity , and it 's lack of flavor .
i waited in line for 10 minutes ( i was the only one in line ) and no one greeted me and or told me they would be with me .
very poor customer service , they are never on time and when you try to call them , good luck .
this place is quite comical . there were late picking me up . the car smelled like smoke .
they are extremely pleasant over the phone . wait not to bad but the clientele are extremely trashy .
called to place a order , was put in hold '' the phone was just set down so i can hear everything in the background waited patiently for 15+ minutes listening to talking , occasional phone ringing and taking other calls to finally get someone back on the phone .
they just decided to change my delivery date by an entire week without telling me .
the doctor was more interested in a payment plan than adjusting my back . i had xrays and was told that i would need 8 months of treatment .
do n't even think about them . quality and staff is a joke . if they are still in business when i write this , god bless whomever uses their services ! the worst quality and the owner is a huge jerk !
would n't come to this location . they care more about closing then customer service . did n't even get a chance to even try the food. i 'll try a different location next time
it was my first time at yeti and it would probably be my last . i found them a little pushy for service upgrades like shellac . the environment leaves much to desire and the workmanship and technique is below par .
first of all , it 's far too expensive so that in itself is enough for me to avoid .
i made an appt for a prenatal massage . the staff was very nice and welcoming however the overall experience was terrible . the massage therapist pressed so hard on my neck that it was sore for 3 days .
unbelievably rude on the phone . will be sending my merchandise back based purely on the outrageously bad customer service . if you want to act like you dont want my business on the phone , then you certainly wo n't get it !
terrible service ! muffins were stale and they would not return my money . the french fries were the worst i have ever eaten . they also let children run around and play and yell . coffee is good and hot though .
ugh . i cringe every time i go in here . the black girls are so rude . they follow you around the store . like come on . i do n't live in toronto so when i come here i like to stock up on things .
got my nails done here july 4 . 5 days later polish comes off one nail all the way . it 's floating in water . they redid one nail for free . 8 days later 2 other nails did the same thing came off completely .
hit truck in front , then car behind hits me ! only minor damage , but the machine is not spacing properly . slow the pace down ! dryers are worthless .
the delivery sushi must be different then sitting at the restaurant and ordering . the sushi i got was absolute garbage .
plz aware table fill up with their own ppl ( friends ) not for customers so find your luck to get a table . 4 tables with 10 chairs . when i pay , one of the customer come up and help me pack .
found titan here on yelp . checked out the website and decided to call to get a quote and travis ( assumed owner ) asked how i found him . when i told him yelp he referred me back to yelp to schedule an appointment .
portions shrunk and price doubled . no more value here . eat home it 's much better . they used to give a lot of food for the money . the food is very good but very small portions .
i was really disappointed with the service ! the store is very nice and i heard so many wonderful things about this place , yet a couple of the employees were rude and cold . i dont think i will be back im all about good service
maybe should have a little bit of common sense when dealing with great customers . false accusations are a fast way to lose business .
ordered a meal with no mushrooms togo . when i got home there was mushrooms in it . called back and told them and the lady argued with me . complete waste of money . will never return .
i 've been signed up with this company since 2005 when i moved to vegas . i have yet to hear anything about any job offers . i check in nearly every week and nothing . if i could rate zero stars , i would !
good wings and cold beer . the rest of the food and the service was horrible .
this place is absolutely horrible . after waiting at the gate to get in we had to go find someone to take our order after patiently waiting we final got our order taken .
i have never in my life returned food to a fast food restaurant , except this wendy 's . twice now . the food is horrible . cold . obviously had been sitting for hours . i will not be returning here ever again .
staff is rude and unprofessional . after my procedure they were quick to ignore a progressing medical issue yet were great at taking my financial information .
i went a few days back to get my brows done and i never wanted to cry so much in my life . my eyebrows looks so terrible the lady made them so thin and so uneven . my eyebrows are naturally pretty thick .
they pushed my hairline after specifically told the barber do not push my hairline back .
i took my porsche in to have a previous convertible repair fixed again that was never properly repaired ( as confirmed by the porsche dealer ) .
i came in for gel polish removal & a regular mani . i was helped by candice . i told her what i needed and she pulled out an electric file to remove the gel polish !
so i 'd love to write a great review but i 'm elsewhere eating dinner and drinking beers . why ? because my friend and i ( both women ) could not justify paying a $ 5 cover to see a fight that 1 . we could careless about .
tried to go to osmow 's and ended up here . the only way to eat it was to wash it down with lots of water . they could n't even get to stuffed grape leaf right . do n't come here .
guess it was my fault for ordering duck wings from a sushi truck , but , still did n't mean i should get sick from them . buried in sauce , not even that tasty . got sick an hour later .
yuck . just yuck . i am not a picky eater and i sent my food back , the rest of our groups food was so bad i did n't even want to order anything else . snob according to a few other reviews ? maybe .
this place sucks ! i have been to many many sushi places . the sushi chef has issues . i asked the server if i could order a special roll and she said yes no problem . i have ordered this roll in a lot of places .
i wish there was a way to give negative stars . these people are the worst plumbing company out there . the office is rude and does n't return calls . the service sucks . the home warranty contracted with people to address some issues in the house .
i know my review will change when i actually get to go here but . not being from the area , i was looking up things to do with my daughter and this came up .
i have been coming since you all opened today was the worse service ever received . i will never be back ! wish i could have seen the manger , but gone for the evening. an hour and a half wait and i had to ask for my bill .
do n't test your patience in this place or you 'll lose it 2 days ago was my third trip to the restaurant and by far the worst experience . my server was absolutely incompetent and unable to do a single thing correctly .
i agree 100 with the negative reviews on here and feel slightly better knowing that it 's not just me - the owner is extremely rude and blatantly irritated with customers .
this place is absolutely disgusting my 18 year old daughter went in looking for a prom dress .
by far the worst service i ever got wings were dry when asked to remake them they refused i 'm just going to go to my usual place for wings is atl wings love them better service there
10 minutes to get a medium black coffee ? really ? that 's what it took today . to make matters worse a pilot came up and said he was in a hurry and the lady behind the counter refused to get him his coffee .
i 'm sorry cause i love good chinese food but i have been to this place twice in the last 1-2 months and got the same thing , the combo fried rice with chicken , beef and shrimp . the meat was kind of questionable every time .
this place does not care about their customers in any way . they charge twice as much as any other place offering the same service . if you have any issues or decide to cancel your contract : good luck getting a refund !
horrible customer service ! waited to order for a minute and no one spoke to me thru the speaker . thinking that it was broken i proceeded to the line , i waited 15 minutes in the line .
went there for shabu shabu . we had to reserve the table a week ahead for 4 people . the rating is so high so we expect the food to be at least average . the shabu shabu is ridiculous .
salad was served with egg including parts of shell . expensive restaurant in a mediocre hotel casino
we went here for a lunch meeting last monday , and ended up having to settle for breakfast food because they were out of several basic ingredients . when we expressed surprise , we were told , welcome to mondays ! ''
i do n't even think this place deserves one full star . the two ladies that run the store have absolutely no manners . my daughter who has also shopped there says they were rude to her too . i refuse to spend another penny there .
although this is called a public auditorium , '' there is n't much public '' about it . most of it is restricted . the public auditorium is a beautiful hall , but i think that it is only reserved for special events .
well , last night was my last time ever eating at black angus . for the price of the food , you would think they 'd have better quality ! i ordered fresh broccoli , and it was disgusting .
was asked to call twice to confirm reservation for larger party . when we showed up , the manager told me that he attempted to call me 20 min after my last call to see if we could push the reservation back , but my phone number was disconnected .
this is worst pharmacy ever ! they told me it would be 4 1 2 hours for my sons prescription . when i came back it was n't ready ! also , they told me they ordered it and it was n't ordered for 10 days !
made an appointment for my husband to get his head professionally shaved by a barber at this establishment . we got an email confirming the appointment for 11 am with noe hernandez . in the email it said for us to be there 5 minutes before his appointment time .
i gave one star because i had to . this was one of the worst experiences ever ! we ordered food which was almost a hour late . then the order was wrong .
worst airport terminal ! ca n't believe in this day and age that they have n't designed this terminal better for business travelers . get a clue from everyone uncomfortably and awkwardly sitting down on the ground near every outlet - which are few and far between .
horrible , horrible , horrible . will never recommend them nor use them ever again . shady company and not the greatest employees . broke many items of mine and they only moved it an apartment building over !
this place is pure shit ! their customer service is shot , and their food is shit ! i can understand charging for sauce , it costs them money , however , they do not need to be rude about it !
every time i take my car in , they tell me something is wrong with my car that is not wrong . then they proceed to give me these ridiculous prices for it to be fixed .
this place is the worst ! instead of worrying about the fights and the police here every night and the homeless people walking around looking for smokes , they worry about people who cause no problem except 1 person who is not registered .
wish i had read the reviews for this location before i placed an online order . it is only a few miles from my house so i placed a simple order of two items and was quoted 25 minutes for delivery time .
with the turnaround in the union cafeteria being pretty rapid , i am shocked that this place is still here and i 'm just waiting to see it go out of business .
wo n't return ! the portions are so small , i could n't believe how small they were for the price you paid . it 's sad to spend $ 85 and leave a place hungry . this place is way overpriced for what you get .
cheddar is better but not here . i was invited to join in on a birthday celebration dinner so i went . i checked out the menu before hand just to see the options i had . nothing wet my whistle but to be polite i went .
i stayed the mgm over the weekend with my wife and ate at the mgm buffet twice . i had it once for dinner ( $ 65 for two of us ) and then again for breakfast ( $ 38 for both of us ) .
really bad ! chicken jambalaya , squash casserole . probably the worst food i 've had in a long time ! how is this person a chef ?
very disappointed with this place . the pizza bread was soft and chewy . for the price i paid i would 've gotten a much better pizza at domino 's and have some change . i was hoping for authentic new york style pizza but it did n't happen .
went out to dinner with my boyfriend and we decided on pf changs in anthem . service was horrible . could n't get a refill to save my life . food was ok '' . only thing remotely good was the dynamite shrimp . rice ?
every time we go into this location it takes about 10 minutes to get greeted then a extra 10 minutes on top of that to have a server come by . we decided to give it another shot last week and again nothing has changed .
rip-off alert ! went for a little school clothes shopping - prices are way out of whack - jeans with holes for $ 18 , faded out t-shirts for $ 2 , and then . went to pay for 5 magazines .
this is the nastiest place i have ever been to in my life ! there are holes in the wall , blood on the walls , mattress is stained and dirty and it was n't cheap ! i 'm definitely contacting health district about this !
update : reported on september 25 , 2015 , pending approval by the us bankruptcy court , haggens will be closing all nv stores within the next year . it was only a matter of time .
they really need to work on there customer service horrible service i will never step foot here horrible service and they lie about prices the manager does n't care either horrible service ! i wish i could give a negative star !
the worst customer service that i have ever experienced . like wow . it 's so not worth the few bucks saved . this company has caused me so much stress . i will never order from them again . just beware .
avoid ! pushy , unprofessional team . if you want to do business with ethical people , go elsewhere . they had every detail on the paperwork wrong and were insisting on signatures .
i had high hopes for this restaurant . very disappointed . i ordered a medium rare filet , and got a well-done strip steak cut down to 6 oz . the manager was nice and offered to recook or take it off the bill .
warning ! do not use this company ! my ac broke and unfortunately my warranty chose them to do the service . these people are unprofessional , very disorganized and flakes .
this place was gross . went for the table cooking had a reservation for 6 and had to wait for a party of 8 and sat for 30 min after we were at the table and had ordered .
horrible . brisket was so dry that it makes memphis championship 's look moist by comparison . ribs were decent , pulled pork was subpar . baked potato casserole '' was nothing more than mashed potatoes , cheese , and green onions .
do n't hire . hired firm for relocation hearing and had everything they needed to win but are refusing to go to hearing with me .
terrible . worst service , smells dirty - the only thing that makes it at all worth the ride up to the bar is the view and it 's nothing you could n't get at the ritz - do n't waste your time .
they do have what appears to be a nice selection of sushi . that said , the mongolian barbecue is lacking at best . the buffet in general is . less . than . impressive . i found the most palatable item to be the terriyaki chicken .
let me start off positively . the restaurant is gorgeous . and the staff were polite , except our server who was cold and only came to us once . we had to call on him to pack our left overs .
if you you are on a quest to find the driest overcooked reheated bbq , you will strike gold with this joint . save yourself the disappointment and dine some place else .
service was sub par , as well as the chocolate sundae . methinks i prefer serendipity !
been here once before . owner 's mother was friendly . came back as a walk in to get my daughters hair done on 2 jan 16 . they was suppose to open at 9 am . was still waiting in the parking lot at 950 am .
very disappointing . we had our meal delivered to our hotel room . while delivery was fairly speedy from hurrier , when we opened our meal we were sadly disappointed . we paid over $ 100 for 3 entrees and 3 deserts .
i 'd give them 0 stars if i can ! no service and they saw me standing there and oh no one else was there and only one car in line . they had about 5 employees working .
i ordered a medium pepperoni and mushroom pizza online for take away . i drove over , paid and saw once i got home that they forgot the pepperoni . when i called the best thing they said they could do was give me two free toppings next time .
i 'm not sure what the other reviews were drinking before eating here or if they 've ever eaten real pizza but this is nothing more than bad chain pizza .
avoid this place ! i kept the receipt because i wanted tell yelp readers that pkwy tavern is terrible ! over priced and awful food , with service that is slow and surly .
tout était mauvais et pas cuit à la livraison . je ne recommande pas du tout pour la nourriture .
the hashbrowns were hard as rock , the wrap which contained a hashbrown was also hard as rock and the sauce or eggs had a soapy aftertaste . first and last time coming to this tim hortons . however , staff was very nice .
i 'm only giving this a one star since i recently left . i was a patient for several years . i finally left because i can no longer tolerate the disrespect for my time .
do n't waste your time here the bar wo n't be open much longer . service is beyond slow . they do have hot girls working there , but good luck trying to get one to serve you .
i was there 3 hours ago . i ordered a buffalo chicken wrap with extra cheese no veggies . for whatever reason you do n't have buffalo sauce with a buffalo chicken wrap . waste of $ $ $ .
i always try to avoid this no frills even though it 's the closest one to me . the pharmacy here is terrible . asking for help feels like asking for a kidney .
went to complain about the service , owner tells me get off his property and said he is going to call the police . conclusion , owner need a course in customer service .
ordered a large pizza with extra cheese for take out last night . the pizza was smaller than most large sized pizzas . the crust was like cardboard and there was very little cheese . $ 15.00 for a very lousy pizza .
one star is being generous . people there are rude ( especially the owner ) and the main reason for the 1 star is for the fact that they do not make your sub the way you like it .
their sign says they close at 7 but i needed to stop in at 645 to grab some ink . i knew exactly which one i needed but they had already locked the doors ? uhhh .
just awful . after 3 service calls with not one of 3 parts between 2 appliances installed and additional damage to dishwasher ( broken clip ) , they made an appointment for a 4th service call and did not show up .
waited about 10 minutes and never saw an actual restaurant employee . no one in the dining area , no one at the bar . there were other people waiting at tables obviously getting impatient .
i do like burger king but i will never go to this one again . the lady in the drive thru taking my order had a terrible attitude .
worst place ever . customer service is horrible . i went to go get my daughter a haircut and the lady ( she looked like she was the manager ) was so rude to me . she seemed annoyed that i wanted to ask her a few questions .
well , it started off good but quickly went down hill ! i bought a groupon which clearly stated that if you purchased the groupon for $ 15 , then you would get $ 30 worth of food and drink . the groupon said 50 off .
this use to be my go to delivery pizza , but a year or so ago the quality and service began to slide , orders were wrong , pizza took 30 to 40 minutes longer than they said to deliver ( i live 5 min away from store ) .
this company will scam you , make no mistake . they feed on acquiring sales contracts with very high change and cancellation rates . their bbb is f '' , the lowest rating available . they simply use public booking sites like hotels.com , expedia and kayak .
went in stood at the front desk for about 3 min and no help finally i asked how long is the wait ? '' little girl on the phone was like one moment .
i wish i could give them 0 stars . every single time i come here and i do mean every it takes about 30 minutes for my food . the slowest arby 's ever . they really need new employees . the managers are ridiculous to .
not awesome ! ordered the chicken taco pizza ( should be called pico de gallo pizza ) , when we got it there was no cheese on it . seriously ?
i checked the last health inspection here before deciding to go and found they had failed for having roaches in the kitchen . will not go back , thats nasty .
i did not even end up eating tonight because of the interaction i had with the manager christina . after i looked over the menu i asked for a sample of the tuna salad .
the food was very over priced and mediocre in quality . i 've had better street cart mexican . the service was super slow and the place was empty . i will never return . i 'd rather eat fast food .
went to this ocotillo location today instead of my usual moon valley location . i had the misfortune to get dr. larry .
had a very disappointing meal there about a year ago - so we decided to return and give it another shot . definitely will not go back ! 1 . restaurant is open to the small patio in front - therefore no a c inside . 2 .
this was an overall terrible service experience and when the food finally came out , it was also bad ! we were greeted promptly and the waitress was nice , we all ordered 3 waters , but we did n't get them until 15 minutes later .
i do n't like to give bad reviews , but this is necessary . do not waste your time with this place ! i bought the groupon , as well .
i wish i can give a zero for the rating . i needed a quote to have a tree removed . they came out did n't knock on the door wrote down a estimate for the wrong tree , and stuck the paper in the door .
was n't even able to order because apparently sliced tomatoes cost more than pepperoni . they only offer 5 standard toppings of which 2 are meat , but to substitute out meat for cheaper vegetables costs you more . super lame .
i live across the street and was so happy when this opened . first couple weeks , food was good , service was great . now , my bread was old , stale and ends were completely hard ( cole turkey ) .
just all around terrible . bad service , sloppy work , and they take no responsibility for the junk they produce . i am so mad at myself for not checking yelp before i gave these people money .
if you order amazon same-day , beware ! seems like they are scamming amazon .
horrible food . the worst service . my order was wrong . who puts wheat bread on italian . the bread was soggy . meat greasy . never go back .
okay , so i thought this was a bakery because it 's called carl 's donuts . i drove up to the strange , industrial location ( i thought , wow , this must be some donut shop ! ) and was told that they only sell donuts wholesale .
the place was amazing when the original owners were running the place . ever since the food has changed but the biggest difference is the customer service and organization of the joint .
i would never recommend or refer anyone here . they are rude , unprofessional , and do cheap work . the manager is arrogant and condescending , to say the least . they repaired '' one of my rings and actually made it worse . fail .
fresh and easy was way better . i do not see how they will stay in business long . vitamins and supplements plus some all natural ( but packaged ) products . no way this is a better business plan than fresh and easy was .
the reason for the one star . the sales staff still acts like what can you do for me '' after all we are the biggest harley dealer in the southwest ! i went in will all intentions of trading my bike and buying a new street glide .
horrible service , their staff has zero customer service and are extremely slow . do n't bother going here to watch football either because you will be inconvenienced . i 've been here many times and every single time i 've had something to complain about .
unsanitary . this location is not clean and the service is horrible . some staff members are good but honestly overall not worth it . find another location .
my experience was absolutely the worst , i tried call this business with no return calls , i needed some work done on my chopper . so i tried emailing count 's and requested someone please get back to me .
defective galaxy 5 phone -- i contacted manager justin fox at the arrowhead sprint store on 1 16 16 as our phone stopped working after getting wet in a rainforest on vacation .
terrible . i agree with another reviewer here , the best part was the tasty after dinner mints , i had two .
this is a nice enough hotel and extremely convenient to a number of bars and restaurants - walking distance for many . the rooms are clean and comfortable , but the decor is fairly dated .
do n't switch to cox business ! whatever savings they are promising you will be list 10 times over with correcting the mistakes made by the installers . wait time on the customer support line is typically 25 minutes .
after ordering a buffalo chicken sandwich i bit into it there was no chicken just a hot mess of buffalo sauce . this place is horrible i gave them a chance to redeem themselves but nope they failed again !
im so mad ! went in purchased a few items and had 6 disposable in exchange for a lipstick . she put the wrong lipstick ( ruby woo ) which i already have ! i did not notice until i wanted to use my new lipstick .
so apparently they are advertising these new bowls they have . but the problem is you ca n't have them , because they ran out of all the ingredients .
i am very disappointed by the service provided by this company . the taxi showed up 20 minutes late and the dispatcher was very rude . avoid using their service if possible .
every 6 months i come back here to check if it 's gotten any better since 's its location is so bloody convenient . unfortunately , i 'm disappointed each time .
we really should be able to give no stars . do n't stay in this crap hole . worst extended stay america ever . the non smoking room stunk so bad . bugs everywhere .
do not order a door from this store ! we had them come measure our front door opening and ordered a custom door four months ago and we are still without a door . paid for the door in full four months ago also .
first off , i call the gym to speak with the manger and i get a very unprofessional answer to the phone , what 's up man , what do you need ? '' i was calling to cancel my membership because i have moved out of state .
we had a good visit until we hit muskoka plunge in the waterpark area . then waited in line for over two and a half hours and the ride was faulty kept stopping . they only had two of the four slides operating and very little staff .
we been wanting to try baci for a long time . what a huge disappointment . the waitress was horrible . the butter for the bread was rock hard . the salad was nothing but lettuce . my mom 's potato waffles were frozen .
i gave this restaurant a second chance after having been disappointed the first time around . my mistake . as another reviewer pointed out , most of the menu is never available .
you can never go wrong with denny 's , nothing ever changes on their menu . veggie omelet with hash browns , cheap easy , fast . i do n't always leave feeling very healthy though .
i no longer use bank of america and yet they are soliciting my business . that 's normal you may think , but listen up . i received personal banking info of a bank of america customer in my post office box for years .
so salty . we ordered an xl pizza and it was so salty even the kids would n't eat it . the salad was full of white iceberg lettuce . not impressed . last time i try it here : (
i came to eat here yesterday with a friend , and what an awful experience it was . the owner got into an argument with an employee and what followed was unlike anything i had ever seen while dining out .
do not go here . they only want top payment for shoddy work . they recommend alot of work then mess it up and try to charge you for that same appointment . you should all be ashamed !
i waited for 30 minutes in the drive thru ! worst service ever for this sonics ! this location sucks ! do not come here ! i am so pissed !
maki were small and not very fresh . both my friend and i felt a bit sick after our meal . not going back .
their food might be good , i do n't know . i walked in one night around 6:30 and got in line behind about four or five other customers .
probably the worst walmart in the world . no joke . super disorganized , always poorly stocked , employees do n't know where things are or if they have them . there 's always homeless people in the parking lot or people passing out fliers .
completely disappointed that this course failed to provide notice they were closed . if you are going to be working on the course and the entire facility is going to be unavailable you should consider posting it on your website .
my husband and i were interested in taking the mob tour ( $ 75 ea ) , followed by the haunted las vegas tour ( $ 60 ea ) .
what is so hard about getting an order right ? terrible customer service and this is the 2nd time i 've had to go back because they ca n't get an order right . it 's doughnuts !
i will have to agree with many of the other one star reviews . it should be zero stars . this particular branch is a joke . i was not satisfied with the cleaning and when i called to speak with the company i was treated so terribly .
service was horrible . no refills took 45 min for a large bowl of pasta which tasted like store bought pasta with ragu sauce . this place makes olive garden taste authentic .
if i could do zero i would . for some reason you have to order at the bar for reverse happy hour pricing , which was deceiving . the buns were stale , the meat was less than decent , and the fries were comparable to burger king .
online scheduling process was a breeze . scheduled my onsite replacement three days out ( first available time slot ) and they kept me updated via multiple email and phone calls along the way .
food was good , service was standard . i dined right before last call so we ordered all our food at once .
they never answer the phone . there is a voicemail box so i left voicemail several times , but noone called me back for a week . i wanted to ask questions about the yoga classes and the studio .
i would give this place no stars if i could . i just ordered the pastrami and chili cheese fries and a chili cheese burger . it was sloppy and bland , and the fries were soggy .
had a very poor experience here . my dog got sick and had not drank any water in about 24hrs so is very dehydrated . i went in because he pooped blood and i was very concerned .
as of yesterday , january 12th , this rexall location was still displaying for sale multiple cartons of milk that expired on or before the 6th of january .
my first , last and only experience to great clips - tempe , mcclintock was absolutely horrible . i was asked by my stylist if i wanted my hair razor cut .
i give this place no stars ! if there was a negative button on here they would get the max . they lie they cheat they steal . do not trust any of these people .
always have problems with century link ! we got signed up for a contract without us knowing and then we got a bill for triple the amount ! how we can get signed up with out us signing i will never know so frustrating !
not sure who the cook was for the evening , but we had dinner there on 1 1 15 and everything was bland from the bean dip and salsa to the main course . it 's like they forgot how to season or did not season at all .
horrible experience . i got new glasses , and one lens had a tiny scratch . i went back , and they said they would order a new lens and replace the damaged one when it came in .
terrible customer service . my first day i went in i had to get sized under my brothers wedding party . a 10-20 minute trip turned into an hour and a half because the staff was poorly trained .
do n't go here . although we loved dr. shields , the office policies ( greed ) are ridiculous . they will make you come in to see the doctor for everything !
probably not my favorite place to go to for mexican . i had the chicken tacos and taco quesadilla and even though it was enough for me i feel like the portions were very small and the chicken was very bland .
thought i 'd expand my pizza choices to other than the major ones . try local all i got was burnt pizza that was all dough and drips of sauce . to make matters worse i called the store and the guy seemed to not care and was rude .
the servers are so unfriendly ( seriously ) here and the soda is always flat , tea is instant and cloudy . if you want sushi you have to find someone that will make it and they are not in a hurry .
this used to be a decent chili 's . wow has it gone downhill . when we arrived we were told they had no iced tea . really ? no iced tea ? things went downhill from there . the service was n't bad but it was n't good .
agree , worst mcdonalds ever . not only did they mess up our order , they messed up the order before ours .
i spent the day looking for a frozen backpack . at last , i saw one in the amuse window . it was $ 30 . i did n't want to spend that much , but i had a meager 5 year old with me .
the ambience is very gloomy . the server seemed very disinterested . the quantity was too less . rice was not cooked properly . all the sauces had a lot of ketchup in it to give it red colour . the food was horrible .
do not use this place . rodent problem . they knew about it . all my stuff was ruined . they sold me an insurance policy that only covered a portion of my damaged stuff .
it still stinks . my wife and son belong there and they are forever billing incorrectly . i 'm just waiting for them to close .
if i could ? i 'd leave 0 stars . i ordered dinner delivery one evening and luckily for me i was n't terribly hungry - they arrived 15 minute shy of 2 hours !
if i could give this place negative stars i would !
i ca n't review the food since i never got my order . i waited for almost an hour for a couple hot dogs on my lunch break . when it got to where i was 30 minutes late back to work i left .
awful ! and the flies were nonstop ! if i could leave this place a negative star i would ! i came to this placed based on the yelp reviews .
do not go here ! after receiving acrylic nails here i had a patch of fungus underneath my nail . never in my life have i had this issue with any other nail salon . i 've heard horror stories but not i 'm in one .
bought a $ 1,000 pair of cartier glasses and within a year the frame has failed and they are claiming they do not have the same frame available even thou they have one that looks exactly the same .
worst thai food i 've ever had . first time i tried them the food was bad , but i gave them the benefit of the doubt , unfortunately it was just as bad . i even ordered something different .
came here for an oil change and waited over 30 minutes when they took me right in and then they charged me over $ 30 for a $ 12.95 oil change . by the time i walked out the door i ended up paying over $ 40 .
this place is an absolute disgrace . just called to request a refund on a $ 30 overcharge . what a treat ! attendant told me to call someone else .
i am about to take my engagement ring back for repairs for the second time . the rep we had at the store was extremely nice but the rest of the store staff are awful .
my experience was not so memorable , the waitress with an attitude saying that my sleeping daughter in her stroller was in her way .
assistant manager mario is very disrespectful . he tries to belittle his customers and does n't anything about customer service . if your employee makes a mistake , apologize for it and make the situation right .
do n't go here unless you feel like sitting for a hour while your tech talks crap about you in another language .
dr. woodson 's nurse practitioner removed a small wart from my daughter face . the np used surgical scissors to cut off the wart . however she cut 3 times the size of the wart deep into her tissue .
parking is absolutely atrocious . 2 pm on a friday and after 20 minutes i gave up and parked at frys . so , between folks driving 2 miles an hour and pedestrians , parking was 40 minutes .
they do not take american express ! also lunch ends pretty early so take advantage when you can ! too bad i ca n't eat here . looks good ! hopefully someone else will take my money .
awful service , waiter was angry when i asked for more wasabi , asked for water that never came . more than half the things i ordered never came , do not recommend coming here with more than 2 people unless you want to wait 40 minutes for your food
just picked up takeout from this place . paid almost $ 15 bucks for an order of chilli beef and received about a quarter of the container filled with beef the rest was all gravy . are you kidding me ? never ordering from here again .
went for an oil change and chris took 10 minutes to tell me they can not do it that day . i asked him if the sheppard store could do it and he was hesitant to call and had to ask other people if he could call .
this location used to be a favorite lunch spot with my coworkers . for some reason , the service has gone downhill . the staff was not courteous and seemed to laugh off our requests .
showed up just now to order takeout for my office , the door was locked and i saw 4 guys sitting at a table eating . i knocked on the door and all 4 of the guys ignored me .
jennifer has been so rude and completely unwilling to assist us . she flat out told another customer that we were making her day unbearable . seriously ? i 've been waiting for 35 minutes for a print assistance .
horrible service it took them 10 min to get our drink order in , and another 20 for our food order and when we finally got our food it was mediocre ! yes it is a cheap deal but definitely not worth it !
they wo n't honor the yelp deals that is advertised on their page ! boo ! looks like we will find another shop .
group of three , and waited 30minutes in line in the rain . hostess came out twice in 10 minute intervals and specifically asked and searched hard and long for a group of 4 , which she pulled from the end of the line . did this twice .
came in here for a beer and the bears game . now , keep in mind i 'm 21 and have n't yet gotten the horizontal driver 's license , yet .
this store is awful ! extremely poor customer service .
i ordered floors and they were delivered damaged . the floors had been discontinued so there was no way i could replace the damaged wood . that is understandable , what made me upset was the return process .
i 've only been to this burger king twice in my life and each time i had to pull over to the front of the building after going to the drive-thru & paid even and had to wait for my food ?
why did i go here ? i had a little voice telling me your going to be sorry '' i knew better who is lin ? and where did she learn to cook ? or did she .
pizza arrived an hour after i ordered . i was told it would arrive 30 minutes or sooner . was n't hot at all . my first time ordering from this location and probably my last . very disappointed
stopped in for lunch on a saturday . only 5 tables occupied . could n't even get anyone to acknowledge us . no greeting . no hey i 'll be with u in minute . '' place looked really cool .
i went here for a friend 's birthday party . unfortunately , the air conditioning unit was either off or broken . it was so freaking hot ! the crowd and location is very ghetto and shady .
the food is flat out terrible ! please do n't subject yourselves to the torture of sitting in this restaurant .
a friend came to visit me tonight and was charged $ 42 taxi fare and $ 8 tip by the driver from airport to my house . i took a taxi once from my house to the airport and was charged $ 14 .
shopped here for an engagement ring , even referred a few friends . arrogant sales people who will even lie and mislead to make a sale . upgraded a ring setting and was lied to about the price i could get for the original setting .
i 'd leave no stars if i could . these guys are travel agents '' , and charge more than $ 60 in fees to use their site . that 's crazy !
this store gave me the worst nightmare ! i went into the store to get a elliptical and when i came home and opened it its a freaking treadmill . call the store and has been transferring six times and asked me the same question over and over again .
terrible communication between the front desk and the outside service , i waited over 20 minutes to tee off . then i did n't get to finish my 18 only 14 holes , because of the slow play .
we came into this store twice in november , first to discuss our options and pricing and then two days later , to combine cell phone plans with my dad and us , and cancelled my mom 's line since she passed away .
i really ca n't understand any good ratings for this restaurant . it is so bad l would give it no stars if l could . no flavor whatsoever . bland . the ginger was pink not the natural color if it was a good sushi restaurant .
worst service ever , waited 40 minutes for my meal . soda tasted nasty . need to fire the manager , the only one working hard was the cashier . ca n't deal with this bad of service do n't come here .
the staff at this location are very lazy and unorganized . i found a pair of shoes i wanted but only one shoe was out in the store . the other was suppose to be behind the counter and i would get both when i paid .
overpriced , not a very expansive menu , gyros were average , ugly interior , i took my friend there from out of town because i thought it would be ok and was incredibly disappointed . location is great . wo n't go back
what can i say that hasnt already been said. golds gym pittsburgh is by far the biggest scam ever dont go and sign up they moment u sign up the fuck u .
worst experience ever ! we went there for the first time and food was horrible . the only thing that was fresh was the tomatoes on my salad .
i would give 0 stars if i could . ordered food for delivery . they did not send rice with yellow daal and were not willing to resend the delivery guy with the rice . absolutely ridiculous . daal is useless with the rice . butter chicken sucked .
i had several jewelry items stolen from me , and got wind that some may have been brought here . i did find one of my rings , which i bought back .
they say they close at 8:00 . but it 's 7:20 and your doors are locked and tables are up . never got to try you guys and now never will .
do not trust them . i went a while ago for an oil change and while waiting they told me it would be $ 700 because my oil is leaking so bad they should n't have even changed it and both my rotors were broke .
first time visiting the sandwich . sandwich was ok considering the tomatoes could have been fresher . upon my last bite , i found a tiny baby roach crawling in my wrapper . i will never return .
i would give zero stars if yelp allows too .
i purchased yelp certificate 10 $ for 20 $ , and when i came to store they wouldnt redeem saying it only for rental . that was not specified in yelp deal . so waisted 10 $ .
ordered food from this place - they messed up our order after it got here an hour and a half after we ordered . the owner said we live too far ( it is a 15 minute drive from the restaurant ) .
i 'm updating this to a 1 instead of a 3 because in the two weeks since i got my nails done , they chipped and peeled significantly and i went and got them redone elsewhere .
very disappointing ! the ice cream was too sweet to eat . i could only eat one third a scoop . it did n't taste that good either . the staff were not friendly at all . not a good experience . i wo n't go back !
such bad service ! everything was given with an attitude ! and service was super slow , took 20min to get my philly steak . at least the philly steak was good !
not worth it . i had the burnt ends and greens . they were the driest burnt ends i 've ever had . i had to chew them forever and it still felt like they were cutting my throat on the way down .
sad sad sad ! my girlfriends and i like to enjoy happy hour and went to whiskey rose to check it out . went there on tuesday and the service was horrible . the bartender payed 99 of her attention to the bar and not her tables .
0 stars for this sonic . very bad customer service . employees are rude & sassy ! do n't come here . ever .
reminded today of what terrible experience was . got notification of the bill : - ) . apparently , billing is slow , too . right on their statement , it shows my insurance paid on 10 20 . i got the bill this morning ( 12 17 ) .
horrible service , the gentleman in the front did not to want our business when asking about designs . very rude , will not come back .
does not honor the gift certificates they sell on restaurants.com . they say does not include alcohol , but that is not stated on gift certificate . also this is a bar and alcohol is their main product . bad business .
when they tell you they are going to call you when your pet 's medication comes in . .they do n't .
i stopped in the other day and i felt as if the people working there were not knowledgeable about the product that they are selling . their very pushy with their product to up sell .
this is the town square location . i called to place an order and the lady who just answered could not answer my question so i asked to speak with someone else and she said hold on .
been here a couple of times and this location holds some sentimental memories for me . my most recent visit will be my last . very disappointing .
since changing hands late last years this place went down hill . any prior good reviews were about rick , the old owner not the folks there now .
if i had the option to give spirit 0 stars , i would . i am telling anyone i speak with about flights not to use their services . on both of our departing and returning flights , we were delayed for two hours for no apparent reason .
this company is so desperate for clients that it will harass and call you constantly even without your approval . at a recent pet expo , we filled out a contest card to win a free cleaning .
the office has the worse front desk staff and billing ever experienced . the wait is almost always a minimum of 2 hours . they do not bill according to insurance and overcharge on copays .
the food was average , and that was the highlight of my visit . the service would have to have improved greatly to just be bad .
horrible customer service , deceptive business practices . avoid them at all costs . my home warrenty keeps sending them out , they always have to come back two or three times to get the issues fixed correctly , even then , it 's never 100 repaired .
agree with all . this was by far the worst rental experience ever . they kept me waiting over an hour at the airport and then when i returned the car they intentionally left me in the lobby when the shuttle went to pick up someone else .
most terrible dining experience of my existence . first of all , it was a total sensory overload . they had a moving playing , music blaring , and then the sound of traffic ( which is admittedly unavoidable ) .
haben meine drei freunde und mich über ne stunde warten lassen , immer zuerst die anderen bedient , die nach uns da waren haben dann mal eins der vier schnitzel gebracht um es uns dann wieder vor der nase weg zu nehmen !
walked in . walked around . looked at things . no one said a word to me . so i left and went to sephora , where they actually talk to me and helped me find things . looks like i will be buying my rocky horror makeup online .
they mopped in front of me and i got wet with the mop . wtf . i used to be a server and was alway told never to mop 5-10 feet near customers .
the course is decent , but i 've had 2 terrible experiences playing here as far as service goes . the ranger and front desk staff are rude and not helpful at all .
they have the absolute worse customer service . so sad . no wonder i goto nordstroms . dillards even treated me nice . time for macy 's to take notes . tisk tisk tisk .
i decided to get their bacon burger and fried mushrooms again . not sure what happened from last time , but it was beyond awful .
e , cruz as it states on my receipt needs to get off his phone while ringing someone up . not texting , literally talking to someone on the phone . how disrespectful and unprofessional .
terrible store online pricing is wrong do n't even want to honor any of there mistakes do n't even want to help a fellow vaper
went to enjoy some good mediterranean fare at a great local jazz bar restaurant tonight and the food was killer . but there is much to be said about the underhanded tactics of our waitress who not only presented me a 15 tip included bill without letting me know .
mega bust with this doctor . no follow through with assisting to get disability equipment needed . patient referred to a different doctor without any contact but via another medical provider attempting to get equipment . phone calls only to be placed on hold or busy signal .
went there for a haircut ( my hair is short ) with lee . while the salon 's lackluster and almost indifferent atmosphere is blatantly apparent , i was more disappointed with the lack of basic hair cutting and styling skills .
this place is about $ 2 more just because it 's in aria . i was about to get a praline latte and i usually get a venti which is $ 5.25 anywhere else . here it 's $ 7.25 ! so i stopped myself short .
had fun here with a couple of friends and drank a lot . what out for the older asian bitch in the bar , super rude and acted like she hated making us drinks . left no tip for her ass . get another job lady
the only time i got to take my family out to the only puerto rican restaurant in az , we were treated like outsiders .
a friend was visiting from out of town and we decided we wanted a pampering experience . so , rather than go to my neighborhood mani pedi place , we went over to old town scottsdale for lunch and a ( we hoped ) luxurious pedicure .
i received a groupon for this place at christmas .
alyssa is the worst bartender and person i 've met . such bad service . so rude . constantly having an attitude . should not work in scottsdale . i would rate her 0 5 stars if i could . the worst
fatty meat low quality with inflated prices . this place has went down substantially
i went to eat lunch here today . i ordered pasta marinara with shrimp and meatballs . everything was good except the shrimp . they were chewy with an intense fishy seafood flavor . which is not normal .
i did a take out order tonight and i was just going to let it go , but the wings were so bad , i 'm really pissed !
slow service , eggs ordered over easy came fully cooked , ordered items only to be told they did n't have them
went with mommy and me group so we got a discounted rate . reason for one star is that my daughter fell in the area between mesh and poles because the zip ties were broken & missing .
tragic place to take care of your pets . we placed both our dogs here for a week and one of our dogs passed away . our dog had toxic poisoning due to mold problems .
so i decided to give it another shot . this location is garbage . went with the philly steak and cheese has onions and peppers on it . so it 's a little steak and all cheese , onions , and peppers . just nasty .
i have got my lashes done before so i knew how it worked but i had never visited the lust for lashes store so was really excited . i went to the new location recently but did n't feel comfortable at all !
this theater is a run down . everything needs updated and the seats are some of the worst seats i 've encountered at a movie theater . the service is ok . i think the only thing keeping this theater alive is that it 's attached to boulder station .
not allowing dogs on your patio , but in the outside of it , makes you decidedly dog unfriendly ! shame on you for the false advertising .
do not go here . i usually have an okay experience but i physically had to flag someone down and ask to be assisted after being seated for 40 minutes .
there is a reason this place is rated so low . if i could give it 0 stars i would . needed to change my name on my dl - to literally add my husbands name to the end of my full name .
terrible customer service . took way longer than was quoted . total lack of communication .
wow . never been to a place where i was blatantly ignored . one star for terrible customer service .
i wish i would have looked on yelp before i bought a new sofa from this place . walked in on a whim and ended up buying . they did n't have the color i wanted in stock so it had to be ordered .
who has reviewed this place in the past . let me start by saying the person taking the orders takes longer taking your order then the person putting your food together . i ordered a large oxtail with rice . to eat in .
sad , being an avid chicago fan but the last 2 times i 've been there , i asked to get comcast chicago , waitress went to bartender .
i 've been here 3 times over a period of 3 years - only when the weather has been cold enough to put me off from venturing any further .
this store is terrible ! always a long wait , even when there are only one or two customers in the store . i have been a t mobile customer for 6 years and have no real issues with my service , except this particular location .
dirty classroom and change rooms and the owner is an ego maniac . she sat there in the change room for 20 mins . bragging how great her flow class is . i walked out .
horrible doctor ! very unprofessional , i do not recommend this place . does not know how to talk to patients , and has a bad attitude !
the worst customer service i have ever experienced . tired , angry , bitter old woman muttering under her breath as i returned an item that did not fit well . shop on line or at nordstroms for better experience .
this place is a joke . the only person who sort of knows anything is the manager victoria . but she spends her time trouble shooting and correcting mistakes that all her employees make .
my husband and i have been coming here for over 15 year . we used to love this place , but it seems the quality has gone down considerably and prices have gone up . tonight my husband had the gyros sandwich and i had the sleepy salad .
food has gone down hill in a very bad way . we ordered $ 70 ( $ 80 with tip ) worth of stuff on august 5th and the food was bad . they said it would arrive in 45-60 minutes .
do n't waste your time if you are a single home owner . we contacted them and asked for an estimate and never received one . they came out and told us they would send us one in 24 48 hours . they did n't follow through .
just had some oatmeal and feel sick right away . this happen 20 minutes ago . i did n't eat anything else but the oatmeal from this place . i am feel weak , and have running duty '' . btw the oatmeal was cold and very watery .
i agree , a sign to seat yourself would be nice . the service was slow and the food cool . it definitely falls on the waitress . she was more busy in her mind then actually . running around spilling coffee dropping menus and accomplishing little .
i reserved a gsxr 750 a couple weeks ahead of time . i arrived for a work trip early just to be able to ride it but was told when i arrived at my designated time that the last user broke the chain '' .
they are horrible ! the staff , the service everything ! the manager fred or whatever his name is , deserves to be fired ! they sold me a car with .
i 'm writing this review as i have now been on hold for over 20 minutes . and before this i got hung up on . good luck ordering from here , i hope you 're not very hungry .
what a disappointment . terrible food . terrible service . this place used to be good . now the prices are way up and the quality is way down . avoid this place like the plague . nothing good about it .
normally i do n't post negative comments but this is literally the worst nail place i 've been to . i got a basic acrylic full set with a french tip , which somehow ended up being about 40 bucks .
we waited at least an hour for our dinner . one table had been waiting 2 hours . the other was waiting 1 1 2 hours . though we had only '' waited one hour we saw what lay ahead .
let me start off by saying that i love shopping at local boutiques and i really wanted to love lotus . the store is very bright , clean and inviting , but that is pretty much the only positives i could say .
had clam chowder . complained about lack of clams . waiter told me is canned . i was astounded . $ 6.49 for a bowl of canned soup . ridiculous . never again .
no one picks up phone . not even sure if phone line still works now . if the location is shut down , can this please be listed and shown as closed to not waste consumers time .
we were picking up and security made us move . we just got there and our person was 20 feet from the car . i 'd say they the most unfriendly of the many airports i have used .
not happy . picked up our rental in the dark and was never offered a chance to inspect the car . everything was fine until we turned in the car .
this is like a place for high school students to hang out . even though it says 18+ they act more like 14 and 15 year old children .
service at this place was horrible . i 've tried many places for ayce sushi and by far the service at this one was garbage . not even the sushi made up for the horrible service . sushi wise it was n't the greatest .
yuck ! this pretty much sums up this price chopper . i really despise going into a grocery store and playing what 's that smell ? ''
if you are looking for a good burrito you wont find it here . i kept giving this place a chance just by trying other things they had to offer , just because someone says its good do n't believe the hype .
terrible experience ! i would not recommend going to this doctor ever . my first visit as i needed new orthotics . i got there early to fill out paperwork my appointment was at 4:15 by 520 i had not been seen yet !
everything is basic with a large price tag . you can have a small pizza ( literally like kids size ) for about 10 bucks ( it 's like 4 bites ) .
terrible ! i ordered a sectional in may . one of the pieces had a rip on it so deanna took it and said she was going to get it replaced . it 's mid september and i 'm still waiting.
we came here for my younger brothers birthday and were very disappointed . customer service was non existent here ! all the employees were too busy texting to notice anyone and even a manager acted like we were a burden to deal with .
this rating is strictly for the waitress name sarah d. i attend a work dinner and decided to have a cocktail before the dinner . ms sarah came to my table with a very dry attitude and very unwelcoming .
i have always loved the clothes and selection in this exclusive boutique . through the years i have bought many clothes in this store and the sales people would even remember my name .
this is the worse nail salon i have ever been to ! i was staying at a nearby hotel and they recommended it , but as soon as i returned to the hotel i told them to never recommend this salon to anyone ever again .
this place so completely failed to make an impression on me that i almost forgot we were here . we stopped in for something to drink on a hot las vegas afternoon . we sat at the bar and ordered two absolute and cranberries .
this place is terrible . time management and organization is a joke . i understand that you book as many appointments as possible to generate revenue but sacrificing service and not following up with appointment times is ridiculous .
where do i start ? first car purchased they spelled my name wrong on the contract ! its not a hard name . also put down wrong information . 2nd purchase .
this place is awful , unorganized and not friendly . i went to this facility after i was in a car accident and received sub-par treatment . additionally , after i ceased treatment , i was sent on a six month long nightmare battle with the billing department .
never again had me waiting 45mins for some onion rings and a drink wo n't ever come here again avoid this sonic for sure !
so pedicure service is horrible i paid twenty dollars to have my feet dipped in hot water and painted i did not get to cut them down file them or anything but painted . and the painting job was done very bad and the technician was very rushed .
employees clearly do n't like working there and if you try to get help you are on your own . fry 's located across the street is far better !
beware ! do not use your credit card here ! i have had my personal & business accounts hacked now four times from this business . after the initial incident last year ( on 2 separate cards ) i was assured security precautions were implemented & systems were updated .
absolutely disgusting ! do not order from here . i have been put off thai food for life . first of all , the quality was appalling . the massaman curry couldnt be described as having sauce , it was more like spicy orange water .
walked in tonight , place was mostly empty . promptly seated by host . three different servers walked by , either serving tables or cleaning dirty tables . nobody came to get a drink order , food order , nothing .
this place is always dirty . tables not cleared , things all over the floor . the drink station is a total wreck . health dept . needs to pay a visit .
rip off i ordered a take out halibut fish and chips meal and what i got was a box full of fries and a tiny piece of fish for 18 $ .
good food but it 's pricey and comes with terrible service . waited 15 minutes to get served after i was seated . the staff did n't even acknowledge mine and my fiancée 's presence .
our car and another one by ours were broke into . there were no surveillance cameras in the garage . dont stay here .
never again ! worst mani pedi i have ever had ! waste of money , even for a groupon . i 'm not going into all of the details , read other reviews , but my experience was very similar .
customer service line was the worst people ive ever talked to in my life . worst bank i 've ever had to deal with .
went to get a carwash this morning at this combined automotive car wash . i do not recommend getting a carwash here . i paid for the basic car wash which was $ 5 and it was to include soft foam '' it was more like sprinkles of water .
endless appetizers ( boneless chicken n spinach artichoke ) was the worst ! chicken taste and look like microwave food and also cold , spinach artichoke was over cooked . did n't taste right . worst appetizers i ever tasted !
if zero stars had been an option i would have chose that . scheduled appt for business to be sprayed . arranged for someone to open business early for them to come when no clients were here and no one showed up . did not call .
embarrassing disappointment ! hosted 4 friends from out of town , who expressed desire for good italian food . checked yelp reviews ; even asked couple of different friends who lived in oakville , who gave thumbs up . they were all wrong .
old lady was bitch , just because i said i was looking . she rolled her eyes at me when i said i wanted to look at the ring and acted as if i did n't have money .
hard to believe , but the absolute worst dining experience i can ever remember . my family came for the fish fry . we were seated ( in a half empty ) dining room for 35 minutes while we watched waitresses mill around the dining room filling napkin holders .
i called this guy on sunday and left a voice message requesting he come out to take a look at my ac unit on monday . never heard back from him .
i wanted to message the management directly but there is no option on the website so i will post here . simply put the most disappointing nice '' meal i 've ever had . started with the jumbo '' shrimp app which was far from jumbo .
worst mcdonald 's ever . it 's not the fact that they can never seem to get my order right , but trying to get it corrected is more hassle than its worth . food is usually cold anyway . but it 's their management that 's the worst .
this is the second time i 've been here and both times the service was awful ! our first visit , we waited forever to get our food , and they messed up the order ! so i had to wait an additional 15 minutes .
hate to give any place less than 2 stars unless i think something is seriously lacking . well , in this case something is seriously lacking .
this guy does the cheapest work possible and cuts corners . he was on the list of covered dentists when i had a sam 's club dental plan .
i get here at 10am , but they still have the door locked . someone finally let me in , and i am told i have to wait . no biggie , he says not more than about 5 minutes .
terrible customer service . .also try renting a 59.00 tux ! there is no such thing . its dishonest advertising practices . also my husband brought my son in for the 2 for 1 suit sale . the salesman matched up his suits with shirts that were 90.00 each !
ordered two pizzas for delivery today and was told 1 hour wait , pizza showed up almost a hour and a half later . person who delivered was during like a mad man and you could tell as soon as you opened the box .
the original technician i had went mia , and me and my friend both had brand new technicians . they were alright . they were fast and appointments were still made on time but for the actual machine and job it was horrible .
look elsewhere for service ! this company is very unprofessional . at the cost of $ 120 monthly i would expect an actual person to arrive at my home and provide a service on a regular basis . this has not been the case with this company .
while personally shopping at this location i was advised by the cashier that the persons operating this location do not believe in christmas . we operate two corporations within 5 minutes from this location and my staff and i will no longer do business with this organization .
i ca n't even believe they call this food . i 'd always heard good things about the shiloh grill and it usually is pretty good -- or at least it once was . must 've gone downhill recently , new management or chefs or something .
paid $ 14 for the gold car wash and it horrible ! half done job ! water marks all over my windows and all over my car ! never going again . he took the tip right out of my hand before i even saw my car !
we went to all american with a group of about 20 after a rehearsal dinner . we had a few drinks , and the maid of honor and a bridesmaid tried to order some food from the kitchen .
please do n't go here unless you have nothing to do . last 3 times i have been there the service has been so slow it 's unbearable ! i think the food is good but it never comes hot . sometimes undercooked .
i 've never been treated more poorly than i was treated at this rite aid . i was belittled in front of other customers and was basically called a liar . very rude pharm techs and pharmacists . i will never go there again !
worst experience ever . old rooms & smelly . breakfast has few choices , i found a dead insect ( i guess it was an ant ) in my egg . i do n't recommend it .
i always like coming here with my family , the drinks are amazing , but today was a different story . the customer service we received was horrible .
this particular location is horrible . the staff is always unfriendly and they never get our order right . on our last visit , they sat us next to a table where the table next to us had an obviously sick customer .
we went in for lunch today . this was our second visit and i must say the first visit a while back went well . we got there about 12 noon .
i was the only one to walk in on a rainy saturday . i ordered pad c ew and squash curry to go , very popular classic dishes .
terrible customer service . was waiting in the middle . a few customers walked in and stood by the side counter and even though acknowledged i was waiting ahead of them the server was rude and had a bad attitude telling me where the line actually is .
if i could give less than one star i would . went here because i got a living social deal for a mani and pedi . both were terrible . there was no hand soak , no exfoliation , and barely got my cuticles done !
called to get some info about shutters extremely rude and hung up on me stay away i will not call them again
update- one of my dogs had a severe bacteria infection once we got home that i noticed a few days later . i 'm starting to wonder if they paid any attention to my dogs whatsoever . i am so disappointed in my experience here .
not too impressed considering it was a quiet hour around 6pm . got a roasted milk tea with tapioca and they left out the tapioca . on top of that i waited a while for my drink when there was no one else in line waiting .
oily as heck . gross ! just thinking about it now makes me want to puke . never going back again . service was okay .
the guy had the worst customer service to me ( a male spending over 1k .
this place is just not that good . every time i go here . it just misses the mark . the service was not very good . the server was not friendly at all , and messes up the timing of orders . the food was average .
absolutely blown away by the good reviews on ths place ! we spent $ 65 on a meal and drinks here and quite simply wished we had n't . the best thing was the guacamole they make at your table .
