dale is a great guy . scheduled me quick and fixed a issue with my car and did not even charge me for this ! great business , highly recommend .

ca n't beat their specials , especially the $ 2 ice cream sandwiches on tuesdays ! the cookies fresh out the oven are just amazing .
does admitting to the fact that we went to this place twice in one day tell you anything ? the carne asada . blew my mind . it was a 8 oz ( ish ) piece of meat that was cooked to my liking .
lori makes the best wedding cakes ! they are super moist and the frosting is perfect . not so sweet that it over powers the cake . she has lots of examples of cakes and works with you to get exactly what you want .
drive past plenty of times came in one night before last call . bartender made me feel so welcomed and told me about all the specials they have going on . heard about wing wednesday and oh my god ! i am not disappointed !
this is by far the best sushi in the gta . the service is awesome and food magnificent with really good prices . i have tried several restaurants and this is my favorite one .

my family and i stayed at the ritz-carlton toronto and had an amazing time . the hotel lives up to the reputation that i expect from this brand . the lobby area was wonderfully inviting . our corner suite room was very spacious and provided great views .
great flavor for a sandwich shop . easy for take outs . their hot sandwiches are better than their cold options . just our take on this place for locals .

note : have not stayed at the resort , my only experience was to walk around the premises and have brunch at prado restaurant . from what i saw and experienced during that time i have to award five stars .
this place is spot on . hands down , probably the best chinese asian food in charlotte . i know it might seem odd to get some asian food from inside the harris teeter , but do not be deceived , this place will not disappoint .
i 'm giving this 5 stars because it 's hot fresh pizza that costs 5 bucks ! stop and think : at qt a single slice of pepperoni pizza costs 2 dollars . with little ceasars you get a whole pie for just a few bucks more .
yes . you read that right . i hit two different chick-fil-a locations in the same day . .and i 'm not even a little ashamed to admit it ! i love their product ! we stopped by this location around noon time .

best breakfast . loved the veggie omelette with hash brown . tony the owner is very nice and friendly .
made reservations through the u-haul website for help unloading upon our arrival in phoenix . somehow u-haul could n't find our reservation on our arrival day and said we have to start from scratch to find help .
the filet mignon with stuffed shrimp was delicious and so were the enchiladas verdes . the red salsa they bring with the chips is amazingggg . .oh and do n't let me forget mango drink . .yum yummm

i just moved to charlotte from maryland a few months ago and , before today , the same hairstylist had cut and colored my hair for the past 6 years .
i 've been here twice and have been very happy with the food , service and the vibe in general .
first visit here after i was referred by a guy at the verizon store . my phone was dropped in some water , it worked fine except the camera lens was very foggy .
went to lenscrafters at this location a few days ago to get a prescription filled . i was looking for an inexpensive pair of single vision glasses . their $ 99 special '' includes a wide variety of frames .
hands down the best restaurant in pittsburgh right now . my boyfriend and i came here to celebrate out anniversary a few month back . we tried their chef 's table with wine pairing .
what a phenomenal atmosphere . 1 ) the people are so welcoming and conversational . 2 ) it 's clean ! 3 ) they will help you with everything and anything ! 4 ) i never felt rushed , had undivided attention !
when i cracked my iphone screen and freaked out , alex was quick to the rescue - and i 'm so grateful . thanks for being awesome alex !

ate here during happy hour . it was so so so good ! their specials are amazing too . we were staying across the street at hard rock , which was really convenient to just walk over .
had a great opportunity that package food for this organization with my family . they had tasks for all ages . the staff was so helpful and friendly- you can tell they believe strongly in their cause and love the children the food will help .

one of the best nail salons here in the valley . great customer service and quality products ! would recommend to everyone .
great service , i asked to resize my ring , did it on the spot , and allowed me to take it home before payment . i love supporting local businesses , especially the mom and pops ! highly recommend !
this is such a hidden gem inside palace station . overall a terrific experience once you get past the smoke filled casino . there is also a great oyster bar in sunset station which is much bigger and nicer in a great casino .
gabriel made me a high security key for a 2010 honda civic . not many locksmiths can make them , but he still got it done . i lost my keys and he came to me . he was great : very quick and professional .
we were in chinatown when my daughter was whining about wanting taco 's . and then we found this place .
having living in philly for 8 years , rita 's arrival in phoenix is nothing short of glorious .
after seeing all the great reviews on yelp we called lights out and scheduled an appointment . they came out at night and searched for scorpions ( only found a couple ) and treated our house .
we called around looking for a great storage facility . the manager , john , answered all our questions and was impressed with his knowledge . after looking at other places in the area , we chose surprise bargain storage .
i just got coupons to this place in the mail . i went with a friend and we were impressed with how large it is . the hostess was kind and showed us to our booth . the sushi is spot on .
i recently had my golf cart repaired here . it was absolutely amazing the job they did . it came back and almost better than new condition . they seem to have washed my seats . they seem to have washed the under carriage .
ah , the go-to place for day drinking and ditching classes with my classmates in medical school . future doctors of america , right here , baby ! the menu offers standard americanized mexican food fare , but there 's just enough variety to have something for everyone .
i 'm in town for a conference and was able to get food from two different food trucks . i got food from taste rite and horchata from burger amore .
excellent quality , delivered on time , flowers lasted over two weeks . very fresh and beautiful .
i could n't find a separate category for this review but it 's for the costco optometrist , dr. anh tieu .

leigh is amazing ! i went to her having never done anything with color to my hair and was nervous to try balayage . i did a ton of research and she seemed to be the best .

my husband and i used nita nanny back in february when i had a business trip in scottsdale and wanted to combine a family vacation with my business trip .
luke 's is the best chicago joint in town . period . their italian sausage is to die for , and so it their italian beef . while the other stores that have recently opened around town are certainly delicious , nothing beats the original .

i 'm so glad that i found greg from yelp . he is honest , fast , professional . he does a phenomenal job and his price is reasonable . i ended up using his service on my other properties .

i live in a chicago suburb and will drive to madison about twice a month just for this place . the eggs benedict is to die for . their salad is delicious . their bread . drool . i ca n't rave enough .
best printing features offered around . combine it with a great design and your business will flourish from great prints alone !

i used to live close to this place this is a really fun local bar with a casual ambience and a small selection of good beers on tap at fair prices which is getting harder and harder to find these days .
yummy inexpensive mexican tortas . very nice staff and extremely clean location . they also have desserts and pan dulce . my torta was n't too big but but was very filling .
great food and service . it reminds me of home with ny style pizza but they offer more than great pizza . great bagels , breakfast , pasta meals and such . they had a location that closed in charlotte but we like them closer to home as well .

dot physical : i needed to renew my dot physical , so tried the new minute clinic at select cvs pharmacy locations .

i am incredibly impressed with chick-fil-a , and particularly with this location . the staff at this location is amazing ! so helpful , fast and on top of it .
every time that i walk in i feel like i 'm stepping into a cross between seinfeld and little shop of horrors . the line was eight deep when the gentleman being served decided it was necessary to inquire into the latest stamp options . fine .
ok so yes this is a fast food restaurant and you 're not going to get a 5-star meal . but regardless , for those who really enjoy chick-fil-a when you find one ( we have none in washington . ) it 's such a treat .
we love everything in this store ! we purchased a beautiful black leather sofa here approximately 11 years ago and it is still looking beautiful ! it 's lasted so long that we have decided we want a different color !

not a pho expert by any means , but this place is good . had the pho sate and it was yummy . the server kept us laughing as well . ca n't complain about affordable food that 's filling .
i go to albert consistently and get amazing results every time . he takes his time with my hair and makes sure i 'm happy before leaving . love the hot towel and quick shoulder massage at the end . highly recommend !

have eaten here a number of times and read the previous reviews too . i do n't know what roasted dog smells like so maybe i missed it but i did look for cobwebs and did not see any .
krispy kreme doughnuts , can i say yum yum yum ! i 'm so addicted to these great little doughnuts from heaven , however this is the only location and the original store in ontario .
never got my haircut in vegas before , looked on yelp and these guys are the real deal . benjamin gave me one of the best fades i 've had in a long time . the reviews on here are correct , definitely coming back .
ca n't think of anything they can really improve on since it was really the great . booked in advance and got a great rate . arrived and you need to stop at the office to pay first .
our family was gifted a membership and it was one of the best gifts i 've received . on hot days , this is a great place to go for indoor fun .
loving it so far . the program is very motivating . only thing missing is showers so i could work out on my way to work . defiantly convenient and recommend to anyone motivated by structure !
kingdom life & bike has great cold brew . they buy it from press coffee . not too expensive . around $ 3-4 . the parking is all free and not too hard to find . preston was awesome and helpful !
okay this was the best $ 160 i 've ever spent in my entire life . the technician was so nice to come to my job and fix my phone screen and it took him like not even an hour .
yesterday i showed my sister and one niece around this great store ! modern lighting ( seems like they always have some new lamps ) . modern furniture ( some of my favorite ) .
there is a young man working in here , looks like he could still be in his teens , that is so knowledgeable . it was impressive for someone so young to be so knowledgeable about even older bikes without sounding snotty about it .
this was my first time in las vegas and i have to say , their vintage scene did not disappoint ! first off the five stars most goes towards the awesome clothes and the awesome owner .
we purchased our rv from wagon trail rv a few weeks ago ( may 2017 ) and the total experience was fantastic . we were treated like first class by everyone .
great place , had the opportunity to receive treatment at lotus , two times now . both times provided relief from cycling injuries , and long standing back issues . was introduced to cupping , which is freaky , but cool .
i called andrew last minute , during barrett jackson week , to do 4 cars for me and my friends on a saturday afternoon . my regular detailer had a truck issue and could n't make it .
price was good , people are real good too , down to earth . no hidden prices just good artists doing there thing . showed up before our flight back home and these guys hooked up my nephew and me .
one of the best dental experiences in a long time . i went for invisalign and he was very clear about what to expect with the process . visits were quick and efficient , and rhonda is friendly and very helpful !
this company is a first class establishment . they came highly recommended by friends who have used them before . very timely , showed up early and finished early . polite movers who diligently took their time when needing to ( tv 's , big furniture etc . )
i love club tattoo ! literally the best place to get pierced in mesa ! the staff is always so nice !

really great taco salad and tacos . highly recommend ! great price point , service was friendly and prompt . food was of good quality . found my new mexi spot for when we are in town ! great taco tuesday $ 1 tacos . thank you
this is probably the best viet pho place in toronto . the soup is amazing and all their dishes have something different compared to other pho places .
all about the sauce ! i had never even heard of mr g 's until a friend brought it to an event yesterday . it smelled delicious and tasted even better . the sauce is sweet , garlicky and flavorful ! perfect complement to the giant al dente rigatoni .
we were lucky to try this place at a slower time . it meant we got to meet the owner and talk to him for a few minutes . first thing i thought was , this guy is extremely nice and really loves making donuts .
really delicious food ! the burritos are great and the tacos are fantastic . grave a big bowl of menus on saturday and sunday . you wo n't regret it .
i have been seeing dawn for botox for years ! she is the only person i will allow to inject my face and there is a reason ! she is fantastic at what she does !
i am writing this review to express my appreciation to this company . i know there 's a lot of places to choose from in town . this place is definitely number one on my list .
the man needed a dress shirt to go with the suit he brought for tonight 's event and lo and behold , we spotted this place and did n't have to deal with arrowhead mall .

yum . absolutely wonderful and tasty melt in your mouth chocolate . will be stopping in to pick us some more treats net time in town .
cam & i love to eat local . we picked out this little gem because when in the west , you eat mexican . it was so weird because what we consider mexican at home and authentic mexican are totally different .
i am italian . i brought mamma home an eggplant sandwich and she was floored . super authentic tasting sauce and the sandwiches are quality . brought hubby home a veal - he couldnt even finish a whole one ( regular size ) !

back again ! my favorite sushi spot . sushi is always fresh and tasty . i recommend this place to many friends and people looking for fantastic sushi spots !
good store , with good prices . a customer can get cash back ( like an atm machine ) . cashiers are also nice and helpful . one thing i like about all aldi stores is they do not play music .
i just had my honda pilot buffed and wax . they did an amazing job and very professional ! i will definitely use them again for my other car !
nice thrift store with nice vintage clothes . the clothes are more pricey than , say , goodwill or salvation army , but it 's well organized and does n't have the thrift store smell . the sales clerk was extremely nice and very helpful .
f45 is the best training out there ! i feel like a boss afterwards and the results are visible ! the energy is high , the workout is very easy to follow but most importantly it 's fun !
why have i never been to this place until now ? went on a thursday for wing night and was totally impressed . the price was great and the buffalo wings were tasty and crispy , without a lot of sauce .
